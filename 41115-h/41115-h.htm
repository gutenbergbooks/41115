<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An English lady of my acquaintance, sojourning at
Baalbek, was conversing with an humble stonecutter, and pointing to the
grand ruins inquired, &ldquo;Why do you not occupy yourself with
magnificent work like that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;those edifices were built by no mortal, but by genii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These genii now represent the demons which in ancient legends were
enslaved by the potency of Solomon&rsquo;s ring. Some of these
folk-tales suggest the ingenuity of a fabulist. According to one,
Solomon outwitted the devils even after his death, which occurred while
he was leaning on his staff and superintending the reluctant labors of
the demons on some sacred edifice. In that posture his form remained
for a year after his death, and it was not until a worm gnawed the end
of his staff, causing his body to fall, that the demons discovered
their freedom.</p>
<p>If this be a fable, a modern moral may be found by reversing the
delusion. The general world has for ages been working on under the
spell of Solomon while believing him to be dead. Solomon is very much
alive. Many witnesses of his talismanic might can be summoned from the
homes and schools wherein the rod is not spared, however much it spoils
the child, and where youth&rsquo;s &ldquo;flower of age&rdquo; bleaches
in a puritan cell because the &ldquo;wisest of men&rdquo; is supposed
to have testified that all earth&rsquo;s pleasures are vanity. And how
many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e423" href="#xd21e423" name=
"xd21e423">vi</a>]</span>parents are in their turn feeling the recoil
of the rod, and live to deplore the intemperate thirst for
&ldquo;vanities&rdquo; stimulated in homes overshadowed by the
fear-of-God wisdom for which Solomon is also held responsible? On the
other hand, what parson has not felt the rod bequeathed to the sceptic
by the king whom Biblical authority pronounces at once the worldliest
and the wisest of mankind?</p>
<p>More imposing, if not more significant, are certain picturesque
phenomena which to-day represent the bifold evolution of the Solomonic
legend. While in various parts of Europe &ldquo;Solomon&rsquo;s
Seal,&rdquo; survival from his magic ring, is the token of conjuring
and fortune-telling impostors, the knightly Order of Solomon&rsquo;s
Seal in Abyssinia has been raised to moral dignity by an emperor
(Menelik) who has given European monarchs a lesson in magnanimity and
gallantry by presenting to a &ldquo;Queen of the South&rdquo;
(Margharita), on her birthday, release of the captives who had invaded
his country. While this is the tradition of nobility which has
accompanied that of lineal descent from the Wise Man, his name lingers
in the rest of Christendom in proverbial connexion with any kind of
sagacity, while as a Biblical personality he is virtually
suppressed.</p>
<p>In one line of evolution,&mdash;whose historic factors have been
Jahvism, Pharisaism, and Puritanism,&mdash;Solomon has been made the
Adam of a second fall. His Eves gave him the fruit that was pleasant
and desirable to make one wise, and he did eat. Jahveh retracts his
compliments to Solomon, and makes the na&iuml;ve admission that deity
itself cannot endow a man with the wisdom that can ensure orthodoxy, or
with knowledge <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e429" href="#xd21e429"
name="xd21e429">vii</a>]</span>impregnable by feminine charms (Nehemiah
xiii.); and from that time Solomon disappears from canonical Hebrew
books except those ascribed to his own authorship.</p>
<p>That some writings attributed to Solomon,&mdash;especially the
&ldquo;Song of Songs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Koheleth&rdquo;
(Ecclesiastes),&mdash;were included in the canon, may be ascribed to a
superstitious fear of suppressing utterances of a supernatural wisdom,
set as an oracle in the king and never revoked. This view is confirmed
and illustrated in several further pages, but it may be added here that
the very idolatries and alleged sins of Solomon led to the detachment
from his personal self of his divinely-conferred Wisdom, and her
personification as something apart from him in various avatars
(preserving his glory while disguising his name), an evolution
culminating in ideals and creeds that have largely moulded
Christendom.</p>
<p>The two streams of evolution here suggested, one issuing from the
wisdom books, the other from the law books, are traceable in their
collisions, their periods of parallelism, and their
convergence,&mdash;where, however, their respective inspirations
continue distinguishable, like the waters of the Missouri and the
Mississippi after they flow between the same banks.</p>
<p>The present essays by no means claim to have fully traced these
lines of evolution, but aim at their indication. The only critique to
which it pretends is literary. The studies and experiences of many
years have left me without any bias concerning the contents of the
Bible, or any belief, ethical or religious, that can be affected by the
fate of any scripture under the higher <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e437" href="#xd21e437" name="xd21e437">viii</a>]</span>or other
criticism. But my interest in Biblical literature has increased with
the perception of its composite character ethnically. I believe that I
have made a few discoveries in it; and a volume adopted as an
educational text-book requires every ray of light which any man feels
able to contribute to its interpretation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">Solomon.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a vast Solomon mythology: in Palestine,
Abyssinia, Arabia, Persia, India, and Europe, the myths and legends
concerning the traditional Wisest Man are various, and merit a
comparative study they have not received. As the name Solomon seems to
be allegorical, it is not possible to discover whether he is mentioned
in any contemporary inscription by a real name, and the external and
historical data are insufficient to prove certainly that an individual
Solomon ever existed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e451src" href=
"#xd21e451" name="xd21e451src">1</a> But that a great personality now
known under that name did exist, about three thousand years ago, will,
I believe, be recognised by those who study the ancient literature
relating to him. The earliest and most useful documents for such an
investigation are: the first collection of Proverbs, x&ndash;xxii. 16;
the second collection, xxv&ndash;xxix. 27; Psalms ii., xlv., lxxii.,
evidently Solomonic; 2 Samuel xii. 24, 25; and 1 Kings iv.
29&ndash;34.</p>
<p>As, however, the object of this essay is not to prove the existence
of Solomon, but to study the evolution of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>the human heart and mind
under influences of which a peculiar series is historically associated
with his name, he will be spoken of as a genuine figure, the reader
being left to form his own conclusion as to whether he was such, if
that incidental point interests him.</p>
<p>The indirect intimations concerning Solomon in the Proverbs and
Psalms may be better understood if we first consider the historical
books which profess to give an account of his career. And the search
naturally begins with the passage in the Book of Kings just referred
to:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And God gave Solomon wisdom and intelligence
exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand on the
seashore. And Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the
children of the East, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser
than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and
Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the surrounding
nations. He spake three thousand parables, and his songs were a
thousand and five. He spake of trees, from the cedar of Lebanon to the
hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, birds,
reptiles, fishes. And there came people of all countries to hear the
wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth, which had heard
of his wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This passage is Elohist: it is the Elohim&mdash;perhaps here the
gods&mdash;who gave Solomon wisdom. The introduction of Jahveh as the
giver, in the dramatic dream of Chapter iii., alters the nature of the
gift, which from the Elohim is scientific and literary wisdom, but from
Jahveh is political, related to government and judgment.</p>
<p>As for Mahol and his four sons, the despair of Biblical historians,
they are now witnesses that this passage was written when those
men,&mdash;or perhaps masculine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3"
href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>Muses,&mdash;were famous, though
they are unknown within any period that can be called historical. As
intimated, they may be figures from some vanished mythology Hebraised
into Mahol (<i>dance</i>), Ethan (the <i>imperishable</i>), Heman
(<i>faithful</i>), Calcol (<i>sustenance</i>), Darda (<i>pearl of
knowledge</i>).</p>
<p>In speaking of 1 Kings iv. 29&ndash;34 as substantially historical
it is not meant, of course, that it is free from the extravagance
characteristic of ancient annals, but that it is the nearest approach
to Solomon&rsquo;s era in the so-called historical books, and, although
the stage of idealisation has been reached, is free from the mythology
which grew around the name of Solomon.</p>
<p>But while we have thus only one small scrap of even quasi-historical
writing that can be regarded as approaching Solomon&rsquo;s era, the
traditions concerning him preserved in the Book of Kings yield much
that is of value when comparatively studied with annals of the
chroniclers, who modify, and in some cases omit, not to say suppress,
the earlier record. Such modifications and omissions, while interesting
indications of Jahvist influences, are also testimonies to the strength
of the traditions they overlay. The pure and simple literary touchstone
can alone be trusted amid such traditions; it alone can distinguish the
narratives that have basis, that could not have been entirely
invented.</p>
<p>In the Book of Chronicles,&mdash;for the division into two books was
by Christians, as also was the division of the Book of Kings,&mdash;we
find an ecclesiastical work written after the captivity, but at
different periods and by different hands; it is in the historic form,
but really does not aim at history. The main purpose of the first
chronicler is to establish certain genealogies and conquests
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>related to the consecration of the house and lineage
of David. Solomon&rsquo;s greatness and his building of the temple are
here transferred as far as possible to David.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e500src" href="#xd21e500" name="xd21e500src">2</a> David captures
from various countries the gold, silver, and brass, and dedicates them
for use in the temple, which he plans in detail, but which Jahveh
forbade him to build himself. The reason of this prohibition is far
from clear to the first writer on the compilation, but apparently it
was because David was not sufficiently highborn and renowned. &ldquo;I
took thee from the sheepcote,&rdquo; says Jahveh, but adds, &ldquo;I
will make thee a name like unto the name of the great ones that are in
the earth;&rdquo; also, says Jahveh, &ldquo;I will subdue all thine
enemies.&rdquo; So it is written in 1 Chronicles xvii., and it could
hardly have been by the same hand that in xxii. wrote David&rsquo;s
words to Solomon:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;It was in my heart to build an house to the
name of Jahveh my God; but the word of Jahveh came to me, saying:
&lsquo;Thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast
shed much blood upon the earth in my sight; behold a son shall be born
unto thee who shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all
his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon [Peaceful], and
I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days: he shall build
an house for my name: and he shall be my son, and I will be his father;
and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for
ever.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In Chapter xvii. Jahveh claims that it is he who has subdued and cut
off David&rsquo;s enemies; his long speech is that of a war-god; but in
the xxii. it is the God of Peace who speaks; and in harmony with this
character <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>all the bloodshed by which Solomon&rsquo;s
succession was accompanied, as recorded in the Book of Kings, is
suppressed, and he stands to the day of his death the Prince of Peace.
To him (1 Chron. xxviii., xxix.) from the first all the other sons of
David bow submissively, and the people by a solemn election confirm
David&rsquo;s appointment and make Solomon their king.</p>
<p>Thus, 1 Chron. xvii., which is identical with 2 Sam. vii., clearly
represents a second Chronicler. The hand of the same writer is found in
1 Chron. xviii., xix., xx., and the chapters partly identical in 2
Samuel, namely viii., x., xi.; the offence of David then being narrated
in 2 Samuel xii. as the wrong done Uriah, whereas in 1 Chron. xxi. the
sin is numbering Israel. The Chroniclers know nothing of the Uriah and
Bathsheba story, but the onomatop&oelig;ists may take note of the fact
that David&rsquo;s order was to number Israel &ldquo;from
<i>Beer-sheba</i> unto Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first ten chapters of 2 Chronicles seem to represent a third
chronicler. Here we find David in the background, and Solomon
completely conventionalised, as the Peaceful Prince of the Golden Age.
All is prosperity and happiness. Solomon even anticipates the silver
millennium: &ldquo;The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as
stones.&rdquo; It is only when the fourth chronicler begins (2 Chron.
x.), with the succession of Solomon&rsquo;s son Rehoboam, that we are
told anything against Solomon. Then all Israel come to the new king,
saying, &ldquo;Thy father made our yoke grievous,&rdquo; and he
answers, &ldquo;My father chastised you with whips, but I with
scorpions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this is so inconsistent with the accounts in the earlier books
of both David and Solomon, that it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>charitable to believe that
the third chronicler had never heard the ugly stories about these two
canonised kings.</p>
<p>In the First Book of Kings, Solomon is made king against the
rightful heir, by an ingenious conspiracy between a wily prophet,
Nathan, and a wily beauty, Bathsheba,&mdash;Solomon&rsquo;s mother,
whom David had obtained by murdering her husband.</p>
<p>It may be remembered here that David had by Bathsheba a son named
Nathan (2 Sam. v. 14; 1 Chron. iii. 5), elder brother of Solomon, from
whom Luke traces the genealogy of Joseph, father of Jesus, while
Matthew traces it from Solomon. It appears curious that the prophet
Nathan should have intrigued for the accession of the younger brother
rather than the one bearing his own name. It will be seen, however, by
reference to 2 Samuel xii. 24, that Solomon was the first legitimate
child of David and Bathsheba, the son of their adultery having died.
John Calvin having laid it down very positively that &ldquo;if Jesus
was not descended from Solomon, he was not the Christ,&rdquo; some
theologians have resorted to the hypothesis that Nathan married an
ancestress of the Virgin Mary, and that Luke gives <i>her</i> descent,
not that of Joseph; but apart from the fact that Luke (iii. 23) begins
with Joseph, it is difficult to see how the requirement of Calvin, that
Solomon should be the ancestor of Jesus, is met by his mother&rsquo;s
descent from Solomon&rsquo;s brother. It is clear, however, from 2 Sam.
xii. 24, 25, that this elder brother of Solomon, Nathan, is a myth.
Otherwise he, and not Solomon, was the lawful heir to the throne
(legitimacy being confined to the sons of David born in Jerusalem), and
Jesus would not have been &ldquo;born King of the Jews&rdquo; (Matt, i.
2), nor fulfilled the Messianic conditions. It is even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>possible
that Luke wished to escape the implication of illegitimacy by tracing
the descent of Jesus from Solomon&rsquo;s elder brother. But the writer
of 1 Kings i. had no knowledge of the Christian discovery that, in the
order of legal succession to the throne, the sons of David born before
he reigned in Jerusalem were excluded. Adonijah&rsquo;s legal right of
succession was not questioned by David (1 Kings i. 6).</p>
<p>When David was in his dotage and near his end this eldest son (by
Haggith), Adonijah, began to consult leading men about his accession,
but unfortunately for himself, did not summon Nathan. This slighted
&ldquo;prophet&rdquo; proposed to Bathsheba that she should go to David
and tell him the falsehood that he (David) had once sworn before Jahveh
that her son Solomon should reign; &ldquo;and while you are
talking,&rdquo; says Nathan, &ldquo;I will enter and fulfil&rdquo;
(that was his significant word) &ldquo;your declaration.&rdquo; The
royal dotard could not gainsay two seemingly independent witnesses, and
helplessly kept the alleged oath. David announced this oath as his
reason,&mdash;apparently the only one,&mdash;for appointing Solomon.
The prince may be credited with being too young to participate in this
scheme.</p>
<p>Irregularity of succession and of birth in princes appeals to
popular superstition. The legal heir, regularly born, seems to come by
mere human arrangement, but the God-appointed chieftain is expected in
unexpected ways and in defiance of human laws and even moralities.
David, or some one speaking for him, said, &ldquo;In sin did my mother
conceive me,&rdquo; and the contempt in which he was held by his
father&rsquo;s other children, and his father&rsquo;s keeping him out
of sight till the prophet demanded him (1 Sam. xvi. 11), look as if he,
also, may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>have been illegitimate. Solomon may have been
technically legitimate, but in any case he was the son of an immoral
marriage, sealed by a husband&rsquo;s blood. The populace would easily
see the divine hand in the elevation of this youth, who seems to have
been himself impressed with the like superstition.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Solomon received his father&rsquo;s last injunctions
as divine commands. At the very time when David is pictured by the
Chronicler in such a saintly death-bed scene, parting so pathetically
with his people, and giving such unctuous and virtuous last counsels to
Solomon, he is shown by the historian of Kings pouring into his
successor&rsquo;s ear the most treacherous and atrocious directions for
the murder of certain persons; among others, of Shimei, whose life he
had sworn should not be taken. Shimei had once called David what Jahveh
also called him, a man of blood, but afterwards asked his forgiveness.
Under a pretence of forgiveness, David nursed his vengeance through
many years, and Shimei was now a white-haired man. David&rsquo;s last
words addressed to Solomon were these:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;He (Shimei) came down to meet me at Jordan, and
I sware to him by Jahveh, saying, &lsquo;I will not put thee to death
with the sword.&rsquo; Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou
art a wise man, and wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him; and
thou shalt bring his hoar head down to the grave in blood.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Such, according to an admiring annalist, were the last words uttered
by David on earth. He died with a lie in his mouth (for he had sworn to
Shimei, plainly, &ldquo;Thy life shall not be taken&rdquo;), and with
murder (personal and vindictive) in his heart. The book opens with a
record that they had tried to revive the aged king <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>by bringing
to him a beautiful damsel; but lust was gone; the only passion that
survived even his lust, and could give one more glow to this &ldquo;man
of blood,&rdquo; was vengeance. Two aged men were named by him for
death at the hands of Solomon, who could not disobey, this being the
last act of the forty years of reign of King David. His dying word was
&ldquo;blood.&rdquo; One would be glad to believe these things
mythical, but they are contained in a record which says:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;David did that which was right in the sight of
Jahveh and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the
days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the
Hittite.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This traditional incident of getting Uriah slain in order to
appropriate his wife, made a deep impression on the historian of
Samuel, and suspicious pains are taken (2 Sam. xii.) to prove that the
illegitimate son of David and Bathsheba was &ldquo;struck by
Jahveh&rdquo; for his parents&rsquo; sin, and that Solomon was born
only after the marriage. Even if the youth was legitimate, the
adherents of the king&rsquo;s eldest son, Adonijah, would not fail to
recall the lust and murder from which Solomon sprang, though the
populace might regard these as signs of Jahveh&rsquo;s favor. In the
coronation ode (Psalm ii.) the young king is represented as if
answering the Legitimists who spoke of his birth not only from an
adulteress, but one with a foreign name:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;I will proclaim the decree:</p>
<p class="line">The Lord said unto me, &lsquo;Thou art my son;</p>
<p class="line">This day have I begotten thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">(It is probable that the name Jahveh was inserted in
this song in place of Elohim, and in several other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>phrases
there are indications that the original has been tampered with.) The
lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Kiss the son lest he be angry</p>
<p class="line">And ye perish straightway.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and others, may have originated the legendary
particulars of plots caused by Solomon&rsquo;s accession, recorded in
the Book of Kings, but at any rate the emphatic claim to his adoption
by God as His son, by the anointing received at coronation, suggests
some trouble arising out of his birth. There is also a confidence and
enthusiasm in the language of the court laureate, as the writer of
Psalm ii. appears to have been, which conveys an impression of popular
sympathy.</p>
<p>It is not improbable that the superstition about illegitimacy, as
under some conditions a sign of a hero&rsquo;s heavenly origin, may
have had some foundation in the facts of heredity. In times when love
or even passion had little connexion with any marriage, and none with
royal marriages, the offspring of an amour might naturally manifest
more force of character than the legitimate, and the inherited sensual
impulses, often displayed in noble energies, might prove of enormous
importance in breaking down an old oppression continued by an automatic
legitimacy of succession.</p>
<p>In Talmudic books (<i>Moed Katon</i>, Vol. 9, col. 2, and <i>Midrash
Rabbah</i>, ch. 15) it is related that when Solomon was conveying the
ark into the temple, the doors shut themselves against him of their own
accord. He recited twenty-four psalms, but they opened not. In vain he
cried, &ldquo;Lift up your heads, O ye gates!&rdquo; But when he
prayed, &ldquo;O Lord God, turn not Thy face from Thine anointed;
remember the mercies of David thy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11"
href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>servant&rdquo; (2 Chron. vi.
42), the gates flew open. &ldquo;Then the enemies of David turned black
in the face, for all knew that God had pardoned David&rsquo;s
transgression with Bathsheba.&rdquo; This legend curiously ignores 1
Chron. xxii., which shows that Jahveh had prearranged Solomon&rsquo;s
birth and name, and had adopted him before birth. It is one of many
rabbinical intimations that David, Bathsheba, Uriah, and Solomon, had
become popular divinities,&mdash;much like Vulcan, Venus,
Mars,&mdash;and as such relieved from moral obligations. Jewish
theology had to accommodate itself ethically to this popular mythology,
and did so by a theory of divine forgiveness; but really the position
of Hebrew, as well as Christian, orthodoxy was that lustful David and
Bathsheba were mere puppets in the divine plan, and their actions quite
consistent with their being souls after Jahveh&rsquo;s own heart.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It may occur to mythographers that I treat as
historical narratives and names that cannot be taken so seriously; but
in a study of primitive culture, fables become facts and evidences. A
grand harvest awaits that master of mythology and folklore who shall
bravely explore the legends of David and Solomon, but in the present
essay mythical details can only be dealt with incidentally. Some of
these may be considered at the outset.</p>
<p>It is said in 1 Kings i.:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Now King David was old and stricken in years;
and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. Wherefore his
servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a
young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and
let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. So they
sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found
Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. And the damsel was
very fair; and she cherished the king and ministered to him; but the
king knew her not.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>That this story is characteristic of lustful David cannot blind us
to the fact of its improbability. Whatever may be meant by &ldquo;the
coasts of Israel,&rdquo; the impression is conveyed of a long journey,
and it is hardly credible that so much time should be taken for a
moribund monarch. Many interpretations are possible of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>name
Abishag, but it is usually translated &ldquo;Father (or source) of
error.&rdquo; However this may be, the story bears a close resemblance
to the search for a wife for Isaac. When Abraham sent out this
commission he also &ldquo;was old and well stricken in age,&rdquo; and
of Rebekah it is said, &ldquo;The damsel was very fair to look upon, a
virgin, neither had any man known her.&rdquo; (Gen. xxiv.) Rebekah
means &ldquo;ensnarer,&rdquo; and Abishag &ldquo;father (source) of
error&rdquo;; and both women cause trouble between two brothers.</p>
<p>There is an Oriental accent about both of these stories. In ancient
Indian literature there are several instances of servants sent out to
search the world for a damsel fair and wise enough to wed the son and
heir of some grand personage. Maya, the mother of Buddha, was sought
for in the same way. This of itself is not enough to prove that the
Biblical narratives in question are of Oriental origin, but there is a
Tibetan tale which contains several details which seem to bear on this
point. The tale is that of Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;, and it is accessible
to English readers in a translation by Schiefner and Ralston of the
&ldquo;Kah-Gyur.&rdquo; (Tr&uuml;bner&rsquo;s Oriental Series.)</p>
<p>Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257; was the seventh son of Mrgadhara, prime
minister of the king of Ko&#347;ala. For this youth a bride was sought
by a Brahman, who in the land of Champa found a beautiful maiden whose
name was also Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;. She was, with other girls,
entering a park, where they all bathed in a tank,&mdash;her companions
taking off their clothes, but Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257; lifting her dress
by degrees as she entered the water. Besides showing decorum, this
maiden conducted herself differently from the others in everything,
some of her actions being mysterious. The Brahman, having contrived to
meet her alone, questioned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>her concerning these peculiarities,
for all of which she gave reasons implying exceptional wisdom and
virtue. On his return the Brahman described this maiden to the prime
minister, who set forth and asked her hand for his son, and she was
brought to Ko&#347;ala on a ship with great pomp. The maiden then for a
long time gives evidence of extraordinary wisdom, one example being of
special importance to our inquiry. She determines which of two women
claiming a child is the real mother. The king and his ministers being
unable to settle the dispute, Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257; said:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Speak to the two women thus: &lsquo;As we do
not know to which of you two the boy belongs, let her who is the
strongest take the boy.&rsquo; When each of them has taken hold of one
of the boy&rsquo;s hands, and he begins to cry out on account of the
pain, the real mother will let go, being full of compassion for him,
and knowing that if her child remains alive she will be able to see it
again; but the other, who has no compassion for him, will not let go.
Then beat her with a switch, and she will thereupon confess the truth
of the whole matter.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In comparing this with the famous judgment of Solomon there appear
some reasons for believing the Oriental tale to be the earlier. In the
Biblical tale there is evidently a missing link. Why should the false
mother, who had so desired the child, consent to have it cut in two?
What motive could she have? But in the Tibetan tale one of the women is
the wife, the other the concubine, of a householder. The wife bore him
no child, and was jealous of the concubine on account of her babe. The
concubine, feeling certain that the wife would kill the child, gave it
to her, with her lord&rsquo;s approval; but after his death possession
of the house had to follow motherhood of the child. If, however,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>the child were dead, the false claimant would be
mistress of the house. Here, then, is a motive wanting in the story of
Solomon, and suggesting that the latter is not the original.</p>
<p>In the ancient &ldquo;Mahosadha Jataka&rdquo; the false claimant
proves to be a Yakshini (a sort of siren and vampire) who wishes to eat
the child. To Buddha himself is here ascribed the judgment, which is
much the same as that of the &ldquo;wise Champa maiden,&rdquo;
Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;. Here, also, is a motive for assenting to the
child&rsquo;s death or injury which is lacking in the Biblical
story.</p>
<p>Here, then, we find in ancient Indian literature a tale which may be
fairly regarded as the origin of the &ldquo;Judgment of Solomon.&rdquo;
And it belongs to a large number of Oriental tales in which the
situations and accents of the Biblical narratives concerning David and
Solomon often occur. There is a cave-born youth, A&#347;uga, son of a
Brahman and a bird-fairy, with a magic lute which accompanies his
verses, and who dallies with Brahmadetta&rsquo;s wife. A king, enamored
of a beautiful foreign woman beneath him in rank, obtains her by a
promise that her son, if one is born, shall succeed him on the throne,
to the exclusion of his existing heir by his wife of equal birth; but
he permits arrangements for his elder son&rsquo;s succession to go on
until induced by a threat of war from the new wife&rsquo;s father and
country to fulfil his promise. A prime minister, Mahaushadha, travels,
in disguise of a Brahman, in order to find a true wife; he meets with a
witty maiden (Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;), who directs him to her village
by a road where he will see her naked at a bathing tank, though she had
taken another road. This minister was, like David, lowly born; a
&ldquo;deity&rdquo; revealed him to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>king, as Jahveh revealed
David to Samuel; he was a seventh minister, as David was a seventh son,
and Solomon also.</p>
<p>Although the number seven was sacred among the ancient Hebrews, it
does not appear to have been connected by them with exceptional wisdom
or occult powers in man or woman. The ideas in which such legends as
&ldquo;The Seven Wise Masters,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Seven Sages,&rdquo;
and the superstition about a seventh son&rsquo;s second-sight,
originate, are traceable to ancient Indo-Iranian theosophy. It may be
useful here to read the subjoined extract from Darmesteter&rsquo;s
introduction to the &ldquo;Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d.&rdquo; Having
explained that the religion of the Persian Magi is derived from the
same source as that of the Indian Rishis, that is, from the common
forefathers of both Iranian and Indian, he says:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Indo-Iranian Asura (the supreme but not the
only god) was often conceived as sevenfold: by the play of certain
mythical formul&aelig; and the strength of certain mythical numbers,
the ancestors of the Indo-Iranians had been led to speak of seven
worlds, and the supreme god was often made sevenfold, as well as the
worlds over which he ruled. The names and the attributes of the seven
gods had not been as yet defined, nor could they be then; after the
separation of the two religions, these gods, named Aditya, &lsquo;the
infinite ones,&rsquo; in India, were by and by identified there with
the sun, and their number was afterward raised to twelve, to correspond
to the twelve aspects of the sun. In Persia, the seven gods are known
as Amesha Spentas, &lsquo;the undying and well-doing one&rsquo;; they
by and by, according to the new spirit that breathed in the religion,
received the names of the deified abstractions, Vohu-man&ocirc; (good
thought), Asha Vahista (excellent holiness), Khshathra Vairya (perfect
sovereignty), Spenta Arma&icirc;ti (divine piety), Haurvat&acirc;t and
Ameret&acirc;ot (health and immortality). The first of them all was and
remained Ahura Mazda; but whereas formerly he had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>only the
first of them, he was now their father. &lsquo;I invoke the glory of
the Amesha Spentas, who all seven have one and the same thinking, one
and the same speaking, one and the same father and lord, Ahura
Mazda,&rsquo;&rdquo; (Yast xix. 16.)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e631src"
href="#xd21e631" name="xd21e631src">1</a></p>
</div>
<p>In Persian religion the Seven are always wise and beneficent. The
vast folklore derived from this Pars&icirc; religion included the
Babylonian belief in seven powerful spirits, associated with the
Pleiades, beneficent at certain seasons, but normally malevolent: they
all move together, taking possession of human beings, as in the case of
the seven demons cast out of Mary Magdalene. In Egypt the seven are
always evil. But neither of these sevens are especially clever. In
Buddhist legends they are not so carefully classified, the seventh son
or daughter manifesting exceptional powers, sometimes of good,
sometimes of evil, but they are usually referred to for this wit or
wisdom. In the Davidian and Solomonic legends these notions are found
as if merely adhering to some importation, and without any perception
of the significance of the number seven. David is an eighth son in 1
Sam. xvi. 10&ndash;13, but a seventh son in 1 Chron. ii. 16. Solomon is
a tenth son in 1 Chron. iii. 1&ndash;6, but the seventh
<i>legitimate</i> son in 2 Sam. xii. 24&ndash;25. The word <i>Sheba</i>
means &ldquo;the seven,&rdquo; but the early scribes appear to have
understood <span class="corr" id="xd21e645" title=
"Source: is">it</span> as <i>shaba</i>, &ldquo;he swears,&rdquo; as in
Gen. xxi. 30&ndash;31, where after the seven ewe lambs have given the
well its name, <i>Beersheba</i>, it is ascribed the significance of an
oath. <i>Bathsheba</i> is commonly translated &ldquo;Daughter of the
Oath,&rdquo; but there can be little doubt that the name means
&ldquo;Daughter of the Seven,&rdquo; and that it originated in the
astute tricks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>by which that fair foreigner made herself
queen-mother and her son king, above the lawful heir, whom she was
instrumental (perhaps purposely) in getting out of the way by
furthering his wishes.</p>
<p>Moral obliquities are little considered in these fair favorites of
translunary powers. Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;, in one Buddhist tale, gets
herself chosen by the Brahman as bride of a great man by her care to
veil her charms at the bath; in another tale she attracts a prime
minister in disguise, and becomes his wife, partly by laying aside all
of her clothing at a bathing tank where she knows he will see her.
Bathsheba&rsquo;s fame is similarly various. Her nudity and ready
adultery with the king did not prevent her from passing into Talmudic
tradition as &ldquo;blessed among women,&rdquo; and to her was even
ascribed the beautiful chapter of Proverbs (xxxi.) in praise of the
virtuous wife! In the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; she is described
as the &ldquo;handmaiden&rdquo; of the Lord in anticipation of the
Christian ideal of immaculate womanhood.</p>
<p>A similar development might no doubt be traced in the beautiful
story of Vi[&rsquo;]s[=]akh[=]a of Shravasti, the most famous of the
female lay-disciples of Buddha. The queries put to her by Buddha and
her explanations of her petitions, which had appeared enigmatic, are
related in Carus&rsquo;s <i>Gospel of Buddha</i>, and in form
correspond with the very different questions and solutions that passed
between the Brahman and the Tibetan Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;, already
mentioned. The name Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;, from a Sanskrit root,
meaning to divide, came to mean selection and intelligence, of all
kinds, but in the matron of Shravast&icirc; wit becomes the genius of
charity, and cleverness expands to enlightenment.</p>
<p>The Queen of Sheba,&mdash;&ldquo;Queen of the Seven,&rdquo;&mdash;is
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>sister spirit of this lay-disciple. Whatever truth
may underlie the legends of this lady, there is little doubt of her
legendary relation to the Wise Women of Buddhist parables,&mdash;to
Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257; of the sevenfold wisdom; and of her who decided
between the rival claimants to the same child; to Ambap&#257;li, the
courtesan, who journeyed to hear Buddha&rsquo;s wisdom and presented to
him and his disciples her park and mansion; and to the Queen of Glory,
whose story belongs &ldquo;to a very early period in the history of
Buddhism.&rdquo; Such is the opinion of Mr. Rhys Davids, whose
translation of the <i>Mah&aacute;sudassana-Sutta</i>, containing an
account of the queen&rsquo;s visit to the King of Glory, in his Palace
of Justice, attended by her fourfold army, may be read in Vol. XI., p.
276, of <i>Sacred Books of the East</i>.</p>
<p>This exaltation of human knowledge and wisdom, travelling to find
it, testing it with riddles and questions, belongs to the cult of the
Magus and the Pundit.</p>
<p>With reference to the seventh son Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;
(all-potential) and his all-wise bride Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;, a
notable parallelism is found in the substantial identity of
&ldquo;Solomon&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Shunnamite,&rdquo; on account of
whom he slew his brother Adonijah. Shunnamite is equivalent to
Shulamite, substantially the same as Solomon (peaceful), but here
probably meaning that she was a &ldquo;Solomoness,&rdquo; a very wise
woman. That such was her reputation appears by the &ldquo;Song of
Songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An equally striking comparison may be made between the naming of
Solomon and the naming of Mahaushadha, the Tibetan
&ldquo;Solomon&rdquo; already mentioned as having married a wise
Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;. Among the many proofs of wisdom given by this
village-born youth was the discovery of the real husband of a woman
claimed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>by two men. One of the men being much the weaker,
there could be no such trial as that proposed in the child&rsquo;s case
by Vi&#347;&#257;kh&#257;. Mahaushadha questioned the two men as to
what they had last eaten, then made them vomit, and so found out which
had told the truth. Let us compare this Tibetan minister&rsquo;s birth
with that of Solomon:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;When the boy came into the world and his
birth-feast was celebrated, the name of Mahaushadha (Great Remedy) was
given to him at the request of his mother, inasmuch as she, who had
long suffered from illness, and had been unable to obtain relief from
the time of the boy&rsquo;s conception, had been cured by him.&rdquo;
(<i>Tib. Tales</i>, p. 133)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jahveh struck the child that Uriah&rsquo;s wife bare unto
David, and ... on the seventh day [it was the seventh son] the child
died.... And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
and lay with her; and she bare a son, and she called his name Solomon.
And Jahveh loved him; and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet,
and he called his name Jedidiah [Beloved of Jah] for Jahveh&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo; (2 Sam. xii.)</p>
</div>
<p>In the Revised Version &ldquo;she called&rdquo; is given in the
margin as &ldquo;another reading,&rdquo; but that it is the right
reading appears by the context: it was she that was
&ldquo;comforted,&rdquo; and in her babe she found
&ldquo;rest&rdquo;&mdash;which &ldquo;Solomon&rdquo; strictly means.
Among the Hebrews the naming of a child was an act of authority, and it
is difficult to believe that in any purely Hebrew narrative a woman
would be described as setting aside the name given by Jahveh himself.
But the high position of woman in the Iranian and the Buddhist
religions is well known.</p>
<p>In comparative studies the questions to be determined concerning
parallel incidents are&mdash;whether they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>are trivial coincidences;
whether they are not based in such universal beliefs or simple facts
that they may have been of independent origin; whether the historic
conditions of time and place admit of any supposed borrowing; if
borrowing occurred, which is the original? With regard to the above
parallelisms I submit that one of them, at least,&mdash;the Judgment of
Solomon,&mdash;is neither trivial nor based in simple facts, and could
not have originated independently of the Indian tale; that the others,
though each, if it stood alone, might be a mere coincidence, are too
numerous to be so explained; that the time and conditions which
rendered it possible that the names of the apes and peacocks (1 Kings
x. 22) imported by Solomon should be Indian proves the possibility of
importations of tales from the same country. (See Rhys David&rsquo;s
<i>Buddhist Birth Stories</i>, p. xlvii.)</p>
<p>The question remaining to be determined&mdash;which region was the
borrower&mdash;cannot be settled, in the present cases, by the relative
antiquity of the books in which they are found; not only are the ages
of all the books, Hebrew and Oriental, doubtful, but they are all
largely made up of narratives long anterior to their compilation. The
safest method, therefore, must be study of the intrinsic character of
each narrative with a view to discovering the country to whose
intellectual and social fauna and flora, so to say, it is most related,
and which of the stories bears least of the faults incidental to
translation. I have applied this touchstone to the above examples, and
believe that the Oriental stories are the originals. The Judgment of
Solomon appears to me to have lost an essential link, a <i>motif</i>,
which it retains in Buddhist versions. And I do not believe that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>any Hebrew Bathsheba could have set aside a name
given her child by a prophet, in the name of Jahveh, in order to
celebrate by another name the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; she found from her
sorrows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the borrowings by other countries from the legend
of Solomon appear much more numerous. In some cases, as the legend of
Jemsh&icirc;d, there appear to have been exchanges between the two
great sages, but the Solomonic traditions seem preponderant in
Vikramadatsya, the demon-commanding hero of India. Solomon became a
proverb of wisdom and liberality in Abyssinia, Arabia, and Persia.
Ideal Sulaimans and Solimas abound. Solomon has influenced the legends
of many heroes, such as Haroun-Alraschid and Charlemagne, and I will
even venture a suspicion that the fame, and perhaps the name, of Solon
have been influenced by the legend of Solomon. Lexicographers give no
account of Solon&rsquo;s name; he is assigned to a conjectural period
before written Greek existed; his interviews with Cr&oelig;sus, given
in Herodotus, are hopelessly unhistorical, and his moralisings to the
rich man recall the book of Proverbs. The Solon of Plato&rsquo;s
<i>Critias</i> is already a mythological voyager, a Sindebad-Solomon,
and his romance of the lost Atlantis is like an idealised rumour of the
Wise Man&rsquo;s Kingdom. Solon&rsquo;s &ldquo;history&rdquo; was
developed by Plutarch, seven centuries after the era assigned to the
sage, out of poetical fragments ascribed to him, and he is represented
as a great trader and traveller in the regions associated with Solomon.
It is doubtful whether this chief of the Seven Sages, whose Solomonic
motto was &ldquo;Know Thyself&rdquo; (cf. Prov. xiv. 8), could he
reappear, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>would know himself as historically costumed by
writers in our era, from Plutarch to Grote.</p>
<p>At any rate there is little doubt of a reference to the Seven
Spentas or to the Seven Sages in Proverbs ix. 1:</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter III.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Wives of Solomon.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to the first book of Kings, Solomon&rsquo;s
half-brother, Adonijah, after the defeat of an alleged (perhaps
mythical) effort to recover the throne of which he had been defrauded,
submitted himself to Solomon. He had become enamored of the virgin who
had been brought to the aged King David to try to revive some vitality
in him; and he came to Bathsheba asking her to request her son the king
to give him this damsel as his wife. Bathsheba proffered this
&ldquo;small petition&rdquo; for Adonijah, but Solomon was enraged, and
ironically suggested that she should ask the kingdom itself for
Adonijah, whom he straightway ordered to execution. The immediate
context indicates that Solomon suspected in this petition a plot
against his throne. A royal father&rsquo;s harem was inherited by a
royal son, and its possession is supposed to have involved certain
rights of succession: this is the only interpretation I have ever heard
of the extreme violence of Solomon. But I have never been satisfied
with this explanation. Would Adonijah have requested, or Bathsheba
asked as a &ldquo;small&rdquo; thing, a favor touching the king&rsquo;s
tenure?</p>
<p>The story as told in the Book of Kings appears diplomatic, and
several details suggest that in some earlier legend the strife between
the half-brothers had a more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>romantic relation to &ldquo;Abishag
the Shunammite,&rdquo; who is described as &ldquo;very fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abishag is interpreted as meaning &ldquo;father of error,&rdquo; and
though that translation is of doubtful accuracy, its persistence
indicates the place occupied by her in early tradition. According to
<i>Yalkut Reubeni</i> the soul of Eve transmigrated into her. She
caused trouble between the brothers, whose Jahvist names, Adonijah and
Jedidiah,&mdash;strength of Jah, and love of Jah,&mdash;seem to have
been at some time related. However this may be, the fair Shunammite, as
represented in the Shulamite of the Song of Songs, fills pretty closely
the outlines set forth in the famous epithalamium (Psalm xlv.) which
all critics, I believe, refer to Solomon&rsquo;s marriage with a bride
brought from some far country. I quote (with a few alterations
hereafter discussed) the late Professor Newman&rsquo;s translation, in
which it will be seen that several lines are applicable to the
Shunammite, whose humble position is alluded to, separated from her
&ldquo;people,&rdquo; and her &ldquo;father&rsquo;s house&rdquo;:</p>

</div>
<p class="first">In this epithalamium the name of Jahveh does not
occur, and Solomon himself is twice addressed as God (Elohim). This
lack of anticipation was avenged by Jahvism when it arrived; the Song
was put among the Psalms and transmitted to British Jahvism, which has
headed it: &ldquo;The majesty and grace of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom. The
duty of the Church and the benefits thereof.&rdquo; Such is the
chapter-heading to a song of bridesmaids,&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>described in the original as &ldquo;a song of
loves&rdquo; and &ldquo;set to lilies&rdquo; (a tune of the time).</p>
<p>There are no indications in the Solomon legend, apart from some
mistranslations, until the time of Ecclesiasticus (B. C. 180), that
Solomon was a sensualist, or that there were any moral objections to
the extent of his harem, which indeed is expanded by his historians
with evident pride.</p>
<p>As to this, our own monogamic ideas are quite inapplicable to a
period when personal affection had nothing to do with marriage, when
women had no means of independent subsistence, and the size of a
man&rsquo;s harem was the measure of his benevolence. Probably there
was then no place more enviable for a woman than Solomon&rsquo;s
seraglio.</p>
<p>The sin was not in the size of the seraglio but in its foreign and
idolatrous wives. (Here our translators again get in an innuendo
against Solomon by turning &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; into &ldquo;strange
women.&rdquo;) Before a religious notion can get itself fixed as law it
is apt to be enforced by an extra amount of odium. Solomon&rsquo;s
mother had married a Hittite, and presumably he would have imbibed
liberal ideas on such subjects. The round number of a thousand ladies
in his harem is unhistorical, but that the chief princesses were of
Gentile origin and religion is clear. The second writer in the first
Book of Kings begins (xi.) with
this gravamen:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Now King Solomon loved many foreign women
besides the daughter of Pharaoh,&mdash;Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite,
Zidonian, and Hittite women, nations concerning which Jahveh said to
the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they
come among you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their
gods: Solomon clave to these in love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>The wisest of men could hardly attend to rules which an unconceived
Jahveh would lay down for an unborn nation centuries later. We must,
however, as we are not on racial problems, consent to a few
anachronisms in names if we are to discover any credible traditions in
the Biblical books relating to Solomon. As Mr. Flinders Petrie has
discovered something like the word &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; in ancient
Egypt, it may be as well to use that word tentatively for the tribe we
are considering. No Israelite, then, is mentioned among Solomon&rsquo;s
wives, and one can hardly imagine such a man finding a bride among
devotees of an altar of unhewn stones piled in a tent.</p>
<p>As our cosmopolitan prince had to send abroad for workmen of skill,
he may also have had to seek abroad for ladies accomplished enough to
be his princesses. That, however, does not explain the number and
variety of the countries from which the wives seem to have come. The
theory of many scholars that this Prince of Peace substituted alliances
by marriage for military conquests is confirmed in at least one
instance. The mother of his only son, Rehoboam, was Naamah the
Ammonitess (1 Kings xiv. 31), and the Septuagint preserves an addition
to this verse that she was the &ldquo;daughter of Ana, the son of
Nahash,&rdquo;&mdash;a king (Hanum) with whom David had waged furious
war. The reference in the epithalamium (Psalms xlv.) to
&ldquo;Tyrus&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; in connexion with 1 Kings v. 12,
&ldquo;there was peace between Hiram and Solomon,&rdquo; suggests that
there also marriage was the peacemaker.</p>
<p>The phrase in 1 Kings iii. 1, &ldquo;Solomon made affinity with
Pharaoh and took Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter&rdquo; suggests, though less
clearly, that some feud may have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>settled in that case
also. That Solomon should have espoused as his first and pre-eminent
queen the daughter of a Pharaoh is very picturesque if set beside the
legend of the &ldquo;Land of Bondage,&rdquo; but the narrative could
hardly have been given without any allusion to bygones had the story in
Exodus been known. Yet the words &ldquo;made affinity&rdquo; may refer
to a racial feud in that direction. This princess brought as her dowry
the important frontier city of Gezer, and her palace appears to have
been the first fine edifice erected in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The commercial r&eacute;gime established by Solomon could hardly
have been possible but for his intermarriages. Perhaps if the Christian
ban had not been fixed against polygamy, and European princes had been
permitted to marry in several countries, there might have been fewer
wars, as well as fewer illicit connexions. The intermarriages of the
large English royal family with most of the reigning houses of Europe,
have been for many years a security of peace, and it is not improbable
that our industrial and democratic age, wherein the working man&rsquo;s
welfare depends on peace, may find in the undemocratic institution of
royalty a certain utility in its power to be prolific in such ties of
peace. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=

<p class="first">Bathsheba&rsquo;s function at Solomon&rsquo;s marriage
is celebrated in the Song of Songs:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and
behold King Solomon,</p>
<p class="line">With the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the
day of his espousals.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Bathsheba, as we have seen, was said to have written
Proverbs xxxi. as an admonition or reproof to her son on his betrothal
with the daughter of Pharaoh. The words of David, &ldquo;Send me Uriah
the Hittite&rdquo; (2 Sam. xi. 6), and the emphasis laid on
Uriah&rsquo;s being a Hittite (a race with which intermarriage was
prohibited, Deut. vii. 1&ndash;5) might have been meant as some legal
excuse for David&rsquo;s conduct. He rescued Bathsheba, Hebraised (1
Chr. iii. 5), from unlawful wedlock, it might be said, and her
exaltation in Talmudic tradition may have been meant to guard the
purity of David&rsquo;s lineage. But the ascription to Bathsheba of
especial opposition to her son&rsquo;s marriage with the daughter of
Pharaoh indicates that the gravamen in Solomon&rsquo;s posthumous
offence lay less in his intermarriage with foreigners than in building
for them shrines of their several deities,&mdash;Istar, Chemosh,
Milcom, and the rest. Against Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter the Talmud
manifests a special animus: she is said to have introduced to Solomon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>a thousand musical instruments, and taught him
chants to the various idols. (<i>Shabbath</i>, 56, col. 2.)</p>
<p>There is a bit of Solomonic folklore according to which the Devil
tempted him with a taunt that he would be but an ordinary person but
for his magic ring, in which lay all his wisdom. Solomon being piqued
into a denial, was challenged to remove his ring, but no sooner had he
done so than the Devil seized it, and, having by its might
metamorphosed the king beyond recognition, himself assumed the
appearance of Solomon and for some time resided in the royal seraglio.
The more familiar legend is that Solomon was cajoled into parting with
his signet ring by a promise of the demon to reveal to him the secret
of demonic superiority over man in power. Having transformed Solomon
and transported him four hundred miles away, the demon (Asmodeus) threw
the ring into the sea. Solomon, after long vagrancy, became the cook of
the king of Ammon (Ano Hanun), with whose daughter, Naamah, he
eloped.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e883src" href="#xd21e883" name=
"xd21e883src">1</a> One day in dressing a fish for dinner Naamah found
in it the signet ring which Asmodeus had thrown into the sea, and
Solomon thus recovered his palace and harem from the demon.</p>
<p>The connexion of this fish-and-ring legend,&mdash;known in several
versions, from the Ring of Polycrates (Herodotus III.) to the heraldic
legend of Glasgow,&mdash;with the Solomonic demonology, looks as if it
may once have been part of a theory that the idolatrous shrines were
built for the princesses while the Devil was personating their lord. In
truth, however, all of these animadversions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>belong
to a comparatively late period. Many struggles had to precede even the
recognition of the idolatrous character of the shrines, and to the last
the Jews were generally proud of the &ldquo;graven images&rdquo; in
their temple,&mdash;including brazen reproductions of the terrible
Golden Calf. At the same time there were no doubt some old priests and
soothsayers to whom these new-fangled things were injurious and odious,
and superstitious people enough to cling to their ancient unhewn altar
rather than to the brilliant cherubim, just as in Catholic countries
the devotees cannot be drawn from their age-blackened Madonnas and
time-stained crucifixes by the most attractive works of modern art.</p>
<p>Although there is no evidence that the God of Israel was known under
the name of either Jah or Jahveh in Solomon&rsquo;s time, there is
little doubt that the rudimentary forces of Jahvism were felt in the
Solomonic age. The furious prophetic denunciations of the wise and
learned which echoed on through the centuries, and made the burden of
St. Paul, indicate that there was from the first much superstition
among the peasantry, which might easily in times of distress be fanned
into fanaticism. The special denunciation of Solomon by Jahveh, and his
suppression during the prophetic age, could hardly have been possible
but for some extreme defiance on his part of the primitive priesthood
and the soothsayers. The temple was dedicated by the king himself
without the help of any priest, and the monopoly of the prophet was
taken away by the establishment of an oracle in the temple. And the
worst was that these things indicated a genuine liberation of the king,
intellectually, from the superstitions out of which Jahvism grew. This
was especially proved by his disregard <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>of the sanctuary claimed
by the murderer Joab, who had laid hold of the horns of the altar. The
altar was the precinct of deity, and beyond the jurisdiction of civil
or military authority; yet when the &ldquo;man of blood&rdquo; refused
to leave the altar our royal forerunner of Erastus compelled the
reluctant executioner to slay him at the altar,&mdash;even the sacred
altar of unhewn stone. As no thunderbolt fell from heaven on the king
for this sacrilege, the act could not fail to be a thunderbolt from
earth striking the phantasmal heaven of the priest. The Judgment Day
for settlement of such accounts was not yet invented, and injuries of
the gods were left to the vengeance of their priests and prophets.</p>
<p>There is an unconscious humour in the solemn reading by English
clergymen of Jahvist rebukes of Solomon for his tolerance towards
idolatry, at a time when the Queen of England and Empress of India is
protecting temples and idols throughout her realm, and has just rebuilt
the ancient temple of Buddha at G&acirc;ya; while the sacred laws of
Brahman, Buddhist, Parsee, Moslem, are used in English courts of
justice. If any modern Josiah should insult a shrine of Vishnu, or of
any Hindu deity, he would have to study his exemplar inside a British
prison. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=

&ldquo;Ammon&rdquo; probably developed the name
&ldquo;Am&icirc;na,&rdquo; given in the Talmud as the name of a
favorite concubine of Solomon, to whom, while he was bathing, he
entrusted his signet ring, and from whom the Devil, Sakhar, obtained it
by appearing to her in the shape of Solomon. This is the version
referred to in the Koran, chapter xxxviii. (Sale.)</p>

<h2 class="main">Solomon and the Satans.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Solomon ascended the throne, Jerusalem must have
been a wretched place, without any art or architecture, with a swarming
mongrel population, mainly of paupers. The holy ark was kept in a tent,
and the altar of unhewn stone accurately symbolised the rude condition
of the people, among whom Solomon could find no workmen of skill enough
to build a temple. It is not easy to forgive him for compelling a good
many of them into the public works; but it was probably no more than a
national conscription of the unemployed paupers in Jerusalem, chiefly
on fortifications for their own defence. There was apparently no
slave-mart, and it seems rather better to conscript people for public
industries than, in our modern way, for cutting their neighbors&rsquo;
throats. Most of them were the remnants of tribes that once occupied
the region, much despised by the Israelites, and probably they looked
on Solomon&rsquo;s plan of building Jerusalem into a city of
magnificence, giving everybody employment and support, as a grand
socialistic movement. An Ephraimite, Jeroboam, who tried to get up a
revolt in Jerusalem does not seem to have found any adherents. The only
people who complained of any yoke&mdash;and their complaint is only
heard of after some centuries&mdash;were the priest-ridden and
prophet-ridden Israelites who had become <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>fanatically excited about
the strange shrines built for the king&rsquo;s foreign wives, and the
splendid carvings and forms in the temple itself. Probably the first
two commandments in the decalogue were put there with special reference
to some Solomonic cult with an &aelig;sthetic taste for graven images
and foreign shrines.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that Solomon, by his patronage of these
foreign religions, detached them from the cruel rites traditionally
associated with them. Among all the censures pronounced against him
none attributes to him any human sacrifices, though such are ascribed
to David and Samuel, (1 Sam. xv. 33, 2 Sam. xxi. 9<span class="corr"
id="xd21e909" title="Source: .)">).</span> The earliest rebukes of
sacrifice in the Bible are those attributed to Solomon. &ldquo;To do
justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than
sacrifice&rdquo; (Prov. xxi. 3). &ldquo;By mercy and truth iniquity is
atoned for&rdquo; (Prov. xvi. 6). &ldquo;Mercy and truth preserve the
king; he upholdeth his throne by mercy&rdquo; (Prov. xx. 28).
&ldquo;Deliver them that are carried away to death: those that are
ready to be slain forbear not thou to save&rdquo; (Prov. xxiv. 11).
&ldquo;Love covereth all transgressions&rdquo; (Prov. x. 12).</p>
<p>Solomon may not indeed have written these and the many similar
maxims ascribed to him, but they are among the most ancient sentences
in the Bible, and they would not have been attributed to any man who
had not left among the people a tradition of humanity and benevolence.
Had the royal &ldquo;idolator&rdquo; or his wives stained their shrines
with human blood the prophets would have been eager to declare it. Two
acts of cruelty are ascribed to Solomon&rsquo;s youth, in the book of
Kings: one of these, the execution of Shimei, carried out his
father&rsquo;s order, but only after Shimei had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>given
fair warning with means of escape; while the other, the execution of
Adonijah (Solomon&rsquo;s brother), if true, is too much wrapped up in
obscurity to enable us to judge its motives; but it cannot be regarded
as historical.</p>
<p>The second historiographer of Kings, setting out to record
Jahveh&rsquo;s anger about Solomon&rsquo;s foreign wives and shrines (1
Kings xi) says, with unconscious humour, that Jahveh raised Satan
against him,&mdash;two Satans. One of these was Hadad, an Edomite, the
other Rezon, a Syrian. The writer says that this was when Solomon was
old, his wives having then turned away his heart after other gods.
Fortunately, however, this writer has embodied in his record some
items, evidently borrowed, which contradict his Jahvistic legend. One
of these tells us that Hadad had been carried away from Edom to Egypt,
when David and his Captain Joab massacred all the males in Edom; that
he there married the sister of Pharaoh; and that he returned to his own
country on hearing of the death of David and Joab. When this occurred,
Solomon, so far from being old, was about eighteen. The Septuagint
(Vatican MS.) says that Hadad &ldquo;reigned in the land of
Edom.&rdquo; We may conclude then that on the return of this heir to
the throne Edom declared its independence, nor is there any indication
that Solomon tried to prevent this. Another contradiction of this
writer is a note inserted about Rezon the Syrian,&mdash;&ldquo;He was
an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon.&rdquo; Not, therefore,
a Satan raised up by Jahveh against Solomon when in old age he had
turned to other gods. Rezon &ldquo;reigned over Syria,&rdquo; and there
is no indication of any expedition against him sent out by Solomon.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>Bishop Colenso (<i>Pentateuch</i>, Vol. III., p.
101), in referring to these points remarks that we do not read of a
single warlike expedition undertaken by Solomon.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e923src" href="#xd21e923" name="xd21e923src">1</a></p>
<p>The remark (1 Kings xi.) about the Satans set against Solomon is
more applicable to the Shiloh traitors, Ahijah and Jeroboam.
Jeroboam,&mdash;a servant whom Solomon had raised to high
office,&mdash;was instigated by Ahijah, a &ldquo;prophet&rdquo;
neglected by Solomon, to his ungrateful treason. Ahijah pretended that
he had a divine revelation that he (Jeroboam) was to succeed Solomon on
account (of course!) of the king&rsquo;s shrines to Istar, Chemosh, and
Milcom. If the narrative were really historic nothing could be more
&ldquo;Satanic&rdquo; than the lies and treacheries related of those
self-seekers. Were the story true, the failure of these divinely
appointed &ldquo;Satans&rdquo; to overthrow the kingdom of Solomon, who
did not arm against them, must have been due to his popularity. In
after times this impunity of the glorious &ldquo;idolator&rdquo; would
have to be explained; consequently we find Jahveh telling Solomon that,
offended as he was by the shrines, he would spare him for his
father&rsquo;s sake, but would rend the kingdom, save one tribe, from
his (Solomon&rsquo;s) son. That this should be immediately followed by
the raising up of &ldquo;Satans&rdquo; to harass Solomon and Israel,
Jahveh having just said the trouble should be postponed till after the
king&rsquo;s death, suggests that the whole account of these quarrels
(1 Kings xi. 14&ndash;40) is a late interpolation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>Up to
that point the old record is unbroken. &ldquo;He had peace on all sides
round about him. And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his
vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan to Beersheba, all the days of
Solomon&rdquo; (1 Kings iv. 24&ndash;25).</p>
<p>Jahveh, in his personal interview with Solomon (1 Kings xi.
11&ndash;13), said, &ldquo;I will surely rend the kingdom from thee and
will give it to thy servant.&rdquo; That is, as explained by the
&ldquo;prophet&rdquo; Ahijah, to Jeroboam. As a retribution and check
on idolatry the selection, besides violating Jahveh&rsquo;s promise to
David (1 Chron. xxii), was not successful: after the sundering of
Israel and Judah into internecine kingdoms, Jeroboam, King of Israel,
established idolatry more actively than either Solomon or his son
Rehoboam. On Jeroboam, his selected Nemesis, Jahveh inflicted his
characteristic punishment of visiting the sins of the fathers on the
children; as David was left the seduced wife whose husband he had
murdered, while his son was executed; as Solomon was left in peaceful
enjoyment of his kingdom and none of the sinful shrines destroyed,
while his son bore the penalty; so now Jeroboam, elect of Jahveh, built
golden calves, surpassed Solomon&rsquo;s offences, and vengeance was
taken on his son Abijah, who died. This Abijah left a son, Baasha, who,
undeterred by these fatalities, continued the &ldquo;idolatries&rdquo;
with impunity for the twenty-four years of his reign, the punishment
falling on his son Elah, who was slain after only two years&rsquo;
reign by his military servant, Zimri. And this Zimri, who thus carried
on Jahveh&rsquo;s decree against idolatry, himself continued &ldquo;in
the ways of Jeroboam,&rdquo; the shrines and idols themselves being
meanwhile unvisited <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39"
name="pb39">39</a>]</span>by any executioner or iconoclast until some
centuries later.</p>
<p>In Josiah there arrived a king, of the line of David, who might seem
by his fury against idolatry to be another &ldquo;man after God&rsquo;s
own heart.&rdquo; He pulverised the images and the shrines, he
&ldquo;sacrificed the priests on their own altars,&rdquo; he even dug
up the bones of those who had ministered at such altars and burnt them.
He trusted Jahveh absolutely. He went to the prophetess, Hulda, who
told him that he should be &ldquo;gathered to his grave in
peace.&rdquo; He was slain miserably, by the King of Egypt, to whom the
country then became subject.</p>
<p>Josephus ascribed the act of Josiah, in hurling himself against an
army that was not attacking him, to fate. The fate was that Josiah,
having exterminated the wizards and fortune-tellers, repaired to the
only dangerous one among them, because she pretended to be a
&ldquo;prophetess,&rdquo; inspired by Jahveh. Her assurances led him to
believe himself invulnerable, personally, and that in his life-time
Jerusalem would not suffer the woes she predicted. Josiah, &ldquo;of
the house of David,&rdquo; seems to have thought that his zeal in
destroying the shrines which his ancestor Solomon had introduced,
mainly Egyptian, would be so grandly consummated if he could destroy a
Pharaoh, that he insisted on a combat. Pharaoh-Necho sent an embassy to
say that he was not his enemy, but on his way to fight the Assyrian:
&ldquo;God commanded me to hasten; forbear thou from opposing God, who
is with me, that he destroy thee not.&rdquo; Here, however, was the
fanatic&rsquo;s opportunity for an Armageddon: Pharaoh had appealed to
what Solomon would have regarded as their common deity, but which to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>Josiah meant a chance to pit Jahveh against the
God of Egypt. On Jahveh&rsquo;s invisible forces he must have depended
for victory. So perished Josiah, and with him the independence of his
country.</p>
<p>Solomon, the Prince of Peace, had made the house of Pharaoh the ally
of his country. Josiah carries his people back under Egyptian bondage.
Solomon had built the metropolitan Temple, whose shrines, symbols,
works of art, represented a catholicity to all races and
religions,&mdash;peace on earth, good will to man. Josiah,
panic-stricken about a holy book purporting to have been found in the
Temple, concerning which the king by his counsellors consulted a female
fortune-teller, makes a holocaust of all that Solomon had built up.

marriage of Hadad with Pharaoh&rsquo;s sister and that of Solomon
shortly after with Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter might naturally, Colenso
says, lead to some amicable arrangement between these two young
princes, representing respectively the ancient domains of Jacob and
Esau, and the Bishop adds the pregnant suggestion: &ldquo;Thus also
would be explained another phenomenon in connexion with this matter,
which we observe in the Jehovistic portions of Genesis&mdash;viz., the
<i>reconciliation</i> of Esau and Jacob&rdquo; (Gen. xxxiii). That
Solomon was on good terms with Edom appears by the fact that his naval
station was in that land (1 K. ix. 26).</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;And when they brought out the money that was
brought into the house of Jahveh, Hilkiah the priest found the book of
the law of Jahveh given by Moses. And Hilkiah answered and said to
Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of
Jahveh.&rdquo; (2 Chron. xxxiv. 14, 15.) The Chronicler adds to the
earlier account (2 Kings xxii. 8) the words &ldquo;given by
Moses,&rdquo; which looks as if the authenticity of the book
(Deuteronomy) had not been without question. The finding of the Book is
set forth in a sort of picture, wherein are grouped the priest, the
theologian, the phantom prophet, the deity, the temple, and the
contribution-box. Every part of the ecclesiastical machine is
present.</p>
<p>One is irresistibly reminded of the finding of the Book of Mormon by
Joseph Smith, although it would be unfair to ascribe Deuteronomist
atrocities to the revelations of the American phantom, Mormon. Nor is
this a mere coincidence. There are lists of the early Mormons which
show a large proportion of them to have borne Old Testament names,
derived from Puritan ancestors. When Solomon set up his philosophic
throne at Harvard University, and the parishes of the Pilgrims became
Unitarian, and Boston became artistic, literary, and worldly, the
Jahvists began to migrate, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>carrying with them their Sabbatarian
Ark, in which so many frontier communities are imprisoned &ldquo;unto
this day.&rdquo; Some of them have become conquerors of Hawaiian
&ldquo;Canaanites,&rdquo; appropriating their lands. But the Vermont
Hilkiah, Joseph Smith, discerned that a new Deuteronomy was needed to
deal with the many American sects, and was guided by an Angel of the
Lord to a spot in Ontario County, New York, where the Book was found
(1827), which he was enabled to translate by the aid of his &ldquo;Urim
and Thummim&rdquo; spectacles, found beside the Book. In the Book were
discussed the principles of all the sects, though not by name, as in
Deuteronomy Moses is made to deal with the conditions which had arisen
since the time of Solomon. Unfortunately for these American Jahvists,
they had left the New English brains behind, with Channing and Emerson,
and had not carried with them enough to produce a western Jeremiah to
save their movement from ridicule and popular hatred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy words were found and I did eat them,&rdquo; says Jeremiah
(xv. 16). Whether, as some scholars think, Jeremiah had any part in the
composition of the Book &ldquo;found,&rdquo; or not, his rage attests
the existence at the time of an important Solomonic School. &ldquo;How
say you, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Behold the
lying pen of the scribes has turned it to a fiction.&rdquo; (viii. 8.)
&ldquo;They are grown strong in the land but not for the faith.&rdquo;
(ix. 3.) &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his
wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might.&rdquo; (ix.
23.)</p>
<p>The Deuteronomist especially aims at suppression of the Solomonic
cult and r&eacute;gime. The law, not found in Exodus, against marriage
with foreigners (Deut. vii. 3)<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span> is especially turned against
Solomon&rsquo;s example by the addition that such a marriage will
&ldquo;turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other
gods.&rdquo; The wife, or other member of a man&rsquo;s family, who
entices him to serve other gods, is to be stoned to death. (xiii.
6&ndash;11.) Moses is represented as anticipating the setting up of
kings, and even the particular events of Solomon&rsquo;s reign.
Solomon&rsquo;s &ldquo;forty thousand stalls of horses&rdquo; (1 Kings
iv. 26), his horses brought out of Egypt (1 Kings x. 28), his wives,
his silver and gold, are all foreseen by the ancient lawgiver, who
provides that: &ldquo;He [your king] shall not multiply horses to
himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt to the end that he
should multiply horses ... neither shall he multiply wives to himself,
that his heart turn not away; neither shall he greatly multiply to
himself silver and gold.&rdquo; (Deut. xvii. 16, 17.)</p>
<p>This Deuteronomist Moses foresaw, too, that some check on the divine
appointments to the throne would be needed. &ldquo;Thou shalt in any
wise set him king over thee whom thy God shall choose: one from among
thy brethren shalt thou set over thee: thou mayest not put a foreigner
over thee.&rdquo; As all of these commandments were received by Moses
from Jahveh himself (Deut. vi. 1, and elsewhere), it is worthy of
remark that there should be no trace of that anger with which Jahveh
met the proposal for a monarchy: &ldquo;they have rejected me, that I
should not be king over them.&rdquo; (1 Sam. viii.) In 1776 Thomas
Paine, in his <i>Common Sense</i>, used this scriptural denunciation of
kings with much effect, and it no doubt contributed much to overthrow
British monarchy in America.</p>
<p>The special denunciations of sun-worship in Deuteronomy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>(iv. 19,
xvii. 3) suggest a probability that Solomon&rsquo;s allusion to the
sun, when dedicating the temple, may have been popularly associated
with the punishable practice alluded to in Job xxxi. 26, of kissing the
hand to the sun and moon. The words of Solomon are cancelled in the
Massoretic text, and do not appear in any English version, but they are
preserved by the LXX., and there declared to be in the book of Jasher.
&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; says Dr. Briggs, &ldquo;recognised by the best
modern critics as belonging to the original text [of 1 Kings viii. 12,
13] which then would read:</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">This suppression of the opening line of the
Dedication, at cost of a grand poetic antithesis, reveals the hand of
mere bigoted ignorance. How many other fine things have been
eliminated, how many reduced to commonplaces, we know not, but the
additions and interpolations in the Old Testament have been nearly all
traced. Many of these are novelettes more prurient than the tales
forbidden in families when found in the pages of Boccaccio and Balzac,
and it is a notable evidence of the mere fetish that the Bible has
become to most sects, that a chorus of abuse instead of welcome still
meets the scholars who prove the quasi-spurious character of the most
odious stories in Genesis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=
"#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>Bishop Colenso seems to have found in such tales only the work of a
Jahvist with a taste for obscene details, but too little attention has
been paid to the investigations of Bernstein, who discovers in many of
these legends a late Ephraimic effort to blacken the character of the
whole house and line of Judah.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e997src" href=
"#xd21e997" name="xd21e997src">2</a> Bernstein does not deal with the
story of Adonijah and Jedidiah (Solomon), whose relative antiquity is
shown, I think, in the fact that no shameful action is ascribed to the
elder brother to account for the deprivation of his primogenitive
right. After Solomon&rsquo;s accession, however, Adonijah proposed to
marry the maiden Abishag, who technically belonged to his
father&rsquo;s harem, and probably this tradition gave a cue to the
inventor of the story of Absalom&rsquo;s having gone to his
father&rsquo;s concubines in order to base on the act a claim to the
kingdom while his father was yet alive.</p>
<p>Absalom&rsquo;s shameful action is supposed to be a fulfilment of
the sentence pronounced against David because of his crime against
Uriah. A close examination of that passage (2 Sam. xii. 10&ndash;14)
must suggest doubts about verses 11, 12, but at any rate the sentence
is not fulfilled by Absalom&rsquo;s alleged act: David&rsquo;s
&ldquo;wives&rdquo; were not taken away &ldquo;before his eyes,&rdquo;
and given &ldquo;unto his neighbor,&rdquo; but some of his concubines
were appropriated by his son. Absalom&rsquo;s act (2 Sam. xvi.
20&ndash;23) and that of David&rsquo;s consigning the concubines to
perpetual isolation or imprisonment (2 Sam. xx. 3) are not alluded to
in David&rsquo;s mourning for Absalom, nor in Joab&rsquo;s rebuke of
this grief. In these strange incoherent items one seems to find the
debris, so to say, of some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>masterly work, picturing a sort of
Nemesis pursuing David and his family for the crime against Uriah.
Ahithophel, who is described as &ldquo;the word of God,&rdquo; was the
grandfather of Bathsheba and the chief friend and counsellor of David,
yet it was he who suddenly becomes a traitor to the King, foreshadowing
Judas&mdash;as his sinister name (&ldquo;brother of lies&rdquo;)
implies&mdash;even to the extent of hanging himself. It was
Bathsheba&rsquo;s grandfather who moved Absalom to dishonor his
father&rsquo;s concubines. But were they only concubines in the
original story, or were they David&rsquo;s wives, as predicted in the
verses 11, 12 (2 Sam. xii.) which seem misplaced and unfulfilled? It
may have been that some of the details of the story were too gross for
preservation, or too disgraceful to David, but I cannot think that we
possess in its original form the tragedy suggested by the presence of
an ancestor of seduced Bathsheba,&mdash;the sinister &ldquo;word of
God&rdquo; Ahithophel,&mdash;and the death of the child of that
adultery, the deflowering of Tamar, David&rsquo;s daughter, the
disgrace and violent death of Amnon, Absalom, apparently of Daniel
also, and finally of Adonijah. What became of the eight wives of David?
Was that prediction ascribed to Nathan, of their defilement, without
any corresponding narrative?</p>
<p>In a previous chapter I have pointed out the improbability that the
fatal wrath of Solomon against Adonijah could have been excited by his
brother&rsquo;s proposal of honorable wedlock with the maiden Abishag,
and conjectured that there may have been a story, now lost, of rivalry
between the brothers for this &ldquo;very fair&rdquo; damsel. Whatever
may have been the real history there is little doubt that there was
substituted for it some real <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>offence by Adonijah, perhaps such as
that afterwards ascribed to Absalom. Bathsheba herself is here the
Nemesis, as her grandfather is in the case of Absalom.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that we are dealing with the age which
produced the thrilling story of Joseph and his brothers, and
Potiphar&rsquo;s wife, and the contrast with his chastity represented
in the profligacy of Judah. Indications have been left in Gen. xxxv. at
the end of verse 22 of the suppression of a story of Reuben and Bilhah,
and no doubt there were other suppressions. How very bad the story of
Reuben was we may judge, as Bernstein points out, by the severity of
his condemnation by Jacob (Gen. xlix.) and by the shocking things about
Judah (Gen. xxxviii.) allowed to remain in the text. In the latter
chapter Bernstein finds the same personages,&mdash;David, Bathsheba,
Solomon,&mdash;acting in a similar drama to that presented in the
Samuel fragments, and under their <span class="corr" id="xd21e1015"
title="Source: diguises">disguises</span> may perhaps be discovered
some of the details suppressed in the Davidic records. Bernstein
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Genesis xxxviii. Judah, the fourth son of the patriarch,
is shown in a light which is to lay bare the stain of his existence.
Judah went to Adullam, where lived his friend &lsquo;Chirah.&rsquo; He
married a Canaanite, the daughter of Shuah.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1020src" href="#xd21e1020" name="xd21e1020src">3</a> His eldest
son was called Er. He (Er) was displeasing in the eyes of Jahveh,
therefore Jahveh slew him. His second son was called Onan: he died in
consequence of his sexual sins. The third son&rsquo;s name was Shelah,
and, as it is mysteriously stated after his name, &lsquo;he was at
Chezib when his mother bare him.&rsquo; Chezib is certainly the name of
a place, and the addition may therefore signify that the mother had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>named the boy Shelah because the father happened
to be in Chezib at the time, absent from home. Chezib has, however, a
second meaning.... Chezib means &lsquo;deception, lie,&rsquo; and is
used by the prophet Micah in this sense (i. 4). Now as Shelah, in our
narrative, serves to deceive Tamar&rsquo;s hopes, held out by Judah,
the allusion to Chezib is appropriate. However this may be,
Judah&rsquo;s sons are all represented as despicable. Even Judah
himself fell into bad ways and was trapped into the snares laid by his
daughter-in-law Tamar, who played the prostitute. Thus only did Judah
found a generation, from which King David is said to descend, from a
son of Judah called Paretz, meaning &lsquo;breaking through,&rsquo; in
which manner he is supposed to have behaved towards his brother at his
birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veiled as the libel is here, it becomes apparent as soon as
we cast a glance upon David&rsquo;s family. The picture which this
libel draws of Judah hits David himself sharply. The
&lsquo;Canaanite&rsquo;&mdash;namely, whom Judah marries [?]&mdash;is
no other than the wife of Uriah the Hittite (murdered at David&rsquo;s
command) whom David himself married adulterously. This wife of Judah is
said to have been the daughter of a man named Shuah. Therefore she is a
Bath-shua, and is thus called (verse 12). But Bathshua is also
Bathsheba herself, as one may conclude from 1 Chron. iii. 5. The eldest
son died, hateful in the sight of God, just like the first son of
Bathsheba (2 Sam. xii. 15). The son of Judah is alleged to have been
called Er (<span lang="he">&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</span>); why? because
reading it backwards (<span lang=
"he">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</span>, wrong) it means
&lsquo;bad,&rsquo; &lsquo;wicked.&rsquo; The second son is called Onan
(<span lang="he">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1504;</span>),
and dies for sexual sins. He is no other than David&rsquo;s son Amnon
(<span lang=
"he">&#1488;&#1463;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;</span>), who
meets his death on account of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49"
href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>sexual sins (2 Sam. xiii). The
Tamar of Judah&rsquo;s story is the same as the Tamar dishonored by
Amnon,&mdash;the daughter of David, who, in spite of her misfortune and
her purity, is, to the entire ruin of her good name, humiliated to a
person who plays the prostitute. And Shelah (<span lang=
"he">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span>) who does not
die,&mdash;add to his name only the letter <span lang=
"he">&#1502;</span>, and you have <span lang=
"he">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1492;</span>,
Solomon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If in the light of these facts, which reveal the mythical character
of some of the worst things told of Judah and David, the blessings of
Jacob (Gen. xlix.) be carefully read, the blessing on Judah will be
found rather equivocal. Colenso translates:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;A lion&rsquo;s whelp is Judah,</p>
<p class="line">Ravaging the young of the suckling ewes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Is this couplet related to Nathan&rsquo;s parable of
the rich man taking away the poor man&rsquo;s one little ewe lamb which
smote the conscience of David?</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;The staff shall not depart from
Judah,</p>
<p class="line">Nor the rod from between his feet</p>
<p class="line">Until Shiloh come.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Is this merely a device of the Ephraimite rebels,
Jeroboamites, pretending to find in a patriarchal prophecy a prediction
that Judah is to be superseded by the descendants of Joseph (on whom
Jacob&rsquo;s encomiums and blessings are unstinted)? Shiloh was always
their headquarters.</p>
<p>It is probable, however, that there is here a play upon words. The
words &ldquo;Until Shiloh come&rdquo; are rendered by some scholars
&ldquo;Till he (Judah) come to Shiloh,&rdquo; and interpreted as
meaning &ldquo;Till he come to rest.&rdquo; The Samaritan version
(&rdquo;<i>donec veniat Pacificus</i>&rdquo;) seems to identify Shiloh
with Solomon. (Colenso, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>Pent. iii. p. 127.) But this is
transparently Shelah over again. Shelomoh (Solomon), Shelah, and Shiloh
are substantially of the same etymological significance. It will be
observed that in Gen. xxxviii. Shelah is the only person whose
character is not blackened. The Ephraimic poem, the &ldquo;Blessings of
Jacob,&rdquo;&mdash;each blessing a <i>vaticinium ex
evento</i>,&mdash;could well afford a half-disguised compliment to
Solomon who had made no attempt to suppress the rebels of
Shiloh,&mdash;the city of Abijah, who originated the Jeroboamic
revolution which divided the Davidic kingdom. Jacob&rsquo;s blessing on
Joseph is of course a blessing on Ephraim: it closes with a transfer of
the crown (from Judah) to &ldquo;him that is a prince among his
brethren.&rdquo; This is &ldquo;rest&rdquo; from the arrows of David,
this is the coming of Shiloh; it occurred under the reign of the Prince
of Peace, Solomon, and it could not be undone by Solomon&rsquo;s son
Rehoboam. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=

<h2 class="main">Solomonic Antijahvism.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ferocities of Josiah and his Jahvists indicate the
presence of an important Solomonist School. Their culture and
tendencies are reflected, as we have seen, in the rage of prophets
against them, and the continuance of their strength is shown in the
preservation of Agur&rsquo;s Voltairian satire on Jahvism, and
Job&rsquo;s avowed blasphemies:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;If indeed ye will glorify yourselves
above me,</p>
<p class="line">And prove me guilty of blasphemy&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Know then, that God hath wronged me!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This translation from Job, quoted from Professor
Dillon, need only be compared with that of the authorised and the
revised versions to show us the <i lang="la">causa causans</i> to-day
which of old added four hundred interpolations to the Book of Job to
soften its criticism.</p>
<p>It appears strange, however, that Professor Dillon has not included
among <i>The Sceptics of the Old Testament</i> three writers in the
composite eighty-ninth Psalm, nor remarked its relation to the Book of
Job. At the head of this wonderful composition the mythical wise man of
1 Kings iv. 31, Ethan, rises (&ldquo;Maschil of Ethan the
Ezrahite,&rdquo; perhaps meaning Wisdom of the Everlasting Helper) to
attest the divine mercies and faithfulness in all generations. This is
in two verses, evidently ancient, which a later hand, apparently, has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>pointed with a specification of the covenant with
David. After the &ldquo;Selah&rdquo; which ends these four verses come
fourteen verses of sermonising upon them, in which nearly all of the
points made by Job&rsquo;s &ldquo;comforters&rdquo; are put in a
nutshell. The sons of God who presented themselves, Satan among them,
in his council (Job i. 6) appear here also (Ps. lxxxix. 6):</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Who among the sons of the gods is like
unto Jahveh,</p>
<p class="line">A God very terrible in the council of the holy
ones.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">After the mighty things that &ldquo;Jah&rdquo; had
done to his enemies have been affirmed an Elohist takes up the burden
and a &ldquo;vision&rdquo; like that of Eliphaz (Job iv. 13) is
appealed to:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy
ones.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The vision&rsquo;s revelation (Job v. 17) &ldquo;Happy
is the man whom God correcteth&rdquo; is also in this psalm (32, 33):
&ldquo;Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
iniquity with stripes, but my mercy will I not utterly take from
him.&rdquo; And Eliphaz&rsquo;s assurance &ldquo;thy seed will be
great&rdquo; (v. 25) corresponds with that in our psalm (verse 36),
&ldquo;His seed shall endure forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the psalmist of the vision has pictured, as if in dissolving
views, the military renown of David, God&rsquo;s &ldquo;servant,&rdquo;
and his &ldquo;horn,&rdquo; pointing to Solomon, God&rsquo;s
&ldquo;first-born,&rdquo; the transgressions of the latter are
intimated (30&ndash;33), but the seer continues to utter the divine
promises:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;My covenant will I not break,</p>
<p class="line">Nor alter the thing that has gone out of my lips.</p>
<p class="line">One thing have I sworn by my holiness;</p>
<p class="line">I will not lie unto David: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">His seed shall endure forever,</p>
<p class="line">And his throne as the sun before me;</p>
<p class="line">As the moon which is established forever:</p>
<p class="line">Faithful is the witness in the sky. Selah.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then breaks out the indignant accuser:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;But thou <span class="sc">hast</span>
cast off and rejected!</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast been wroth with thine
&lsquo;anointed&rsquo;;</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast broken the covenant with thy
&lsquo;servant,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast profaned his crown to the very dust;</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast broken down all his defences;</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin!</p>
<p class="line">All the wayfarers that pass by despoil him;</p>
<p class="line">He is become a reproach to his neighbors.</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast exalted the right-hand of his
adversaries,</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>
<p class="line">Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his sword,</p>
<p class="line">And hast not enabled him to stand in battle.</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast made his brightness to cease,</p>
<p class="line">And hurled his throne down to the ground.</p>
<p class="line">The days of his youth thou hast shortened:</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast covered him with shame! Selah.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A sarcastic &ldquo;Selah,&rdquo; or &ldquo;so it
<span class="sc">is</span>!&rdquo;&mdash;if Eben Ezra&rsquo;s
definition of Selah be correct.</p>
<p>Then follow four verses by a more timid plaintiff, who, almost in
the words of Job (e.g., x. 20), reminds Jahveh of the shortness of
life, and the impossibility of any return from the grave, and asks how
long he intends to wait before fulfilling his promises. He also
supplies Koheleth with a text by the pessimistic exclamation,
&ldquo;For what vanity hast thou created all the children of
men&rdquo;!</p>
<p>After this writer has sounded his &ldquo;Selah,&rdquo; another
rather more bitterly reminds Jahveh, in three verses, that not only his
chosen people are in disgrace, but his own enemies are triumphant.</p>
<p>(These two are much like the writer of Psalms xliv. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>9&ndash;26, who almost repeats the points made by
the above three remonstrants, and asks Jahveh, &ldquo;Why sleepest
thou?&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Finally a Jahvist doxology, fainter than any appended to the other
four books, completes this strange eighty-ninth psalm:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Praised be Jahveh for evermore!</p>
<p class="line">Amen, and Amen!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Great is Diana of the Ephesians! Or is this the
half-sardonic submission of Job under the whirlwind-answer, which
extorted from him no tribute except a virtual admission that when the
ethical debate became a question of which could wield the loudest
whirlwinds, he surrendered!</p>
<p>In Job&rsquo;s case the only recantation is that of Jahveh himself,
who admits (xlii. 7) that Job had all along spoken the right thing
about him (Jahveh). The epilogue is a complete denial of Jahvist
theology.</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s small voice of scepticism which followed the whirlwind
was never silenced. The fragment of Agur (Proverbs xxx. 1&ndash;4)
appears to have been written as the alternative reply of Job to Jahveh.
Job had said, &ldquo;I am vile, I will lay my hand upon my mouth, I
have uttered that I understand not.&rdquo; Agur adds ironically,
&ldquo;I am more stupid than other men, in me is no human understanding
nor yet the wisdom to comprehend the science of sacred things.&rdquo;
Then quoting Jahveh&rsquo;s boast about distributing the wind (Job
xxxviii. 24), about his &ldquo;sons shouting for joy&rdquo;
(<i>Ibid.</i> 7), and giving the sea its garment of cloud (<i>Ibid.</i>
9), Agur, the &ldquo;Hebrew Voltaire,&rdquo; as Professor Dillon aptly
styles him, asks: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55"
name="pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Who has ascended into heaven and come
down again?</p>
<p class="line">Who can gather the wind in his fists?</p>
<p class="line">Who can bind the seas in a garment?</p>
<p class="line">Who can grasp all the ends of the earth?</p>
<p class="line">Such an one I would question about God: &lsquo;What is
his name?</p>
<p class="line">And what the name of his sons, if thou
knowest?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The stupid Jahvist commentator who follows Agur
(Proverbs xxx. 5&ndash;14) and in the same chapter interpolates 17 and
20, has the indirect value of rendering it probable that there were a
great many &ldquo;Agurites&rdquo; (a &ldquo;bad generation&rdquo; he
calls them) and that they were rather aristocratic and distrustful of
the masses. This commentator, who cannot understand the Agur fragments,
also shows us, side by side with the brilliant genius, lines revealing
the mentally pauperised condition into which Jahvism must have fallen
when such a writer was its champion.</p>
<p>It is tolerably certain that such fragments as those of Agur imply a
literary atmosphere, a cultured philosophic constituency, and a long
precedent evolution of rationalism. Such peaks are not solitary, but
rise from mountain ranges. Professor Dillon, whose admirable volume
merits study, finds Buddhistic influence in Agur&rsquo;s
fragments.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1232src" href="#xd21e1232" name=
"xd21e1232src">1</a> But I cannot find in them any trace of the recluse
or of the mystic; he does not appear to be even an
&ldquo;agnostic,&rdquo; for when he says &ldquo;I have worried myself
about God and succeeded not,&rdquo; the vein is too satirical for a
mind interested in theistic speculations. He is a man of the
world,&mdash;more of a Goethe than a Voltaire; he regards Jahveh as a
phantasm, is well domesticated in his planet, and does not moralise on
the facts of nature in the Oriental any more than in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>the
Pharisaic way. He appears to be a true Solomonic philosopher and
naturalist. I cannot agree to Professor Dillon&rsquo;s omission of the
&ldquo;Four Cunning Ones&rdquo; (Proverbs xxx. 24&ndash;28), because
they are not of the same metrical form as the others, and lead
&ldquo;nowhither.&rdquo; The lines</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;The ants are a people not strong,</p>
<p class="line">Yet they provide their meat in the summer,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">no doubt led to the famous parable of Proverbs vi.
6&ndash;11, &ldquo;Go to the ant, thou sluggard.&rdquo; Being there
imbedded in an otherwise commonplace editorial chapter, they may have
been derived from some commentator on Agur.</p>
<p>Agur apparently represents the Solomonic thinkers brought with the
rest of the people under the trials that made Israel the Job of
nations. They are such as those who led astonished Jeremiah to ask
&ldquo;what kind of wisdom is in them?&rdquo; (Jeremiah viii.) They
&ldquo;do not recognise Jahveh&rsquo;s judgments&rdquo;; in
&ldquo;shame, dismay, captivity, they have rejected Jahveh&rsquo;s
word.&rdquo; The exquisite humor of Agur shows that these philosophers
did not lose their serenity. Agur sees man passing his life between two
insatiable daughters of the ghoul, &ldquo;the Grave and the
Womb,&rdquo;&mdash;Birth and Death,&mdash;and amid the inevitable evils
of life he will be wise to refrain from rage and lay his hand upon his
lips.</p>
<p>But silence was just what the Jahvist omniscients could not attain
to. Notwithstanding Jahveh&rsquo;s confession that Job was right in his
position, and the orthodox wrong in their theory that all evil is
providential, the &ldquo;comforters&rdquo; rise again in the
commentator who begins (Proverbs xxx. 5):</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Every word of God is perfected.</p>
<p class="line">He is a shield to them that trust in Him,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>and proceeds in verse 14 with his inanities. And these have
prevailed ever since. Even Jesus, when he took up the burden of Wisdom,
and rebuked the Jahvist superstition that those on whom a tower fell
were subjects of a judgment, must have his stupid corrector to add,
&ldquo;Except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish.&rdquo; This
simpleton&rsquo;s superstition has taken the place of the great
successor of Solomon, and to-day, amid all the learning of Christendom,
is proclaiming that the Father is &ldquo;permitting&rdquo; all the
Satans,&mdash;war, disease, earthquake, famine,&mdash;to harry his
children just to test them or to chasten them. Why should omnipotence
create a race requiring worse than inquisitorial tortures for its
discipline? In all the literature of Christendom there is not one
honest attempt to deal with the evils and agonies of nature; and at
this moment we find theists apotheosizing the &ldquo;Unknowable from
which all things proceed,&rdquo; without any appreciation of the fact
that in the remote past Jahvism sought the same refuge, and that it was
proved by Job a refuge of fallacies. In an awakening moral and humane
sentiment Job stands in this latter day upon the earth, and again
steadily repeats his demand why one should respect an Unknowable from
whom all things,&mdash;all horrors and agonies,&mdash;proceed.</p>
<p>Ethically we are required to do no evil that good may come;
theologically, to worship a deity who is doing just that all the time.
This is no doubt a convenient doctrine for the Christian nations that
wish to preserve their own property and peace at home, while acting as
banditti in remote continents and islands. All such atrocities are
enacted and adopted as part of the providential plan of spreading the
Gospel, latterly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>&ldquo;civilisation&rdquo;; but it is very certain
that there can be no such thing as national civilisation until evil is
recognised as evil, good as good,&mdash;the one to be abhorred, the
other loved,&mdash;and no deity respected whose government would wrong
a worm. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=

<p class="first">The legend of the Queen of Sheba forms not only a
poetic prologue to the epical tradition of Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom, but
has a substantial connexion with the character of that wisdom, to whose
final personification she contributed.</p>
<p>The corresponding Oriental stories do not necessarily deprive this
legend of historic basis, but point to the region of this &ldquo;Queen
of the Seven (Sheba).&rdquo; Those Oriental pilgrimages of eminent
women to great sages, however invested with magnificence, are natural;
even such romances could not have been invented unless in accordance
with the genius of the country in which they were written. There is no
antecedent improbability that a queen, belonging to a region in which
her sex enjoyed large freedom, should have made a journey to meet
Solomon.</p>
<p>The Abyssinians, who regard her as the founder of their dynasty, at
the same time show how little characteristic of their country the
legend was, by their ancient tradition, that it was the Queen of Sheba
who provided that no woman should sit on the throne, forever! They
claim that this Queen is referred to in Psalm xlv.&mdash;&ldquo;At thy
right hand doth stand the Queen, in gold of Ophir.&rdquo; This psalm is
Solomonic, but the reference is no doubt to the Queen Mother, Bathsheba
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=

Solomon&rsquo;s successor, nor the daughter of Pharaoh, who was his
especially distinguished wife, is described as a queen,&mdash;this
indeed not being a Jewish title for a king&rsquo;s wife. The psalm
indicates much glory to be conferred on a woman by wedlock with
Solomon, but not that he was to derive any honor from either or all of
the &ldquo;threescore queens&rdquo; assigned him in later times (Cant.
vi. 8). In another Solomonic Psalm (lxxii.) it is said:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;The kings of Tarshish and of the isles
shall bring presents:</p>
<p class="line">The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts,</p>
<p class="line">Yea, all kings shall fall down before him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">No glory is here supposed to be derivable from a
woman, and an inventor would probably have merely devised a saga on the
last of the lines just quoted, which is adapted in 1 Kings iv. 34, to
Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom, or he would have imagined some instance of a
particularly illustrious monarch coming to pay homage to Solomon. That
the only example particularized is that of a woman carries some signs
of reality.</p>
<p>Assuming that there was ever any King Solomon at all, this Psalm
lxxii., whose Hebrew title is &ldquo;Of Solomon,&rdquo; might have been
written in the height of his reign. The title of &ldquo;God&rdquo;
given him in Psalm xlv. is here approximated in the opening line,
&ldquo;Give the King thy judgments, O Elohim,&rdquo; and in the
ascription to him of such virtues and such beneficent dominion,
&ldquo;from the river (Euphrates) to the ends of the earth,&rdquo;
without any further reference to God, that an indignant Jahvist expands
the doxology (18, 19) to include a reclamation for Jahveh. The ancient
lyric closes with verse 17, which says of Solomon: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;His name shall endure forever;</p>
<p class="line">His name shall have emanations as long as the sun;</p>
<p class="line">Men shall bless themselves in him;</p>
<p class="line">All nations shall call him The Happy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The Jahvist answers:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Blessed be Jahveh Elohim, the Elohim of
Israel,</p>
<p class="line">Who alone doeth wondrous things,</p>
<p class="line">And blessed be His glorious name forever;</p>
<p class="line">And let the whole earth be filled with His glory.</p>
<p class="line">Amen, and Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now in this beautiful poem (omitting the doxology) the
elation is especially concerning some connexion with Sheba. In verse 10
it is said &ldquo;The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts&rdquo;;
in verse 15, &ldquo;To him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.&rdquo;
These lines might have been written on the announcement of a royal
visit, or meeting, which had not mentioned a queen. But what country is
indicated by Sheba (the Seven)? In India there are seven holy rivers,
and seven holy Rishis, represented by the seven stars of the Great
Bear. But these correspond with the Seven Rivers of Persia which enter
into the Persian Gulf, in the Avesta called Satav&aelig;sa, a
star-deity. In the Y&icirc;r Yast 9 it is said:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Satav&aelig;sa makes those waters flow down to
the seven Karshvares of the earth, and when he has arrived down there
he stands, beautiful, spreading ease and joy on the fertile countries,
thinking in himself, &lsquo;How shall the countries of the Aryas grow
fertile?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>As there are seven heavens, there are seven earths (Karshvares), and
these, as already shown (<i>ante</i> II.), are presided over by the
&ldquo;seven infinite ones&rdquo; (Amesha-Spentas). Of these seven the
first is Ahura Mazda himself, and of the others only one is
female&mdash;Arma&icirc;ti, genius of the earth. Of this wonderful and
beautiful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>personification more must be said presently, but
it may be said here that Arma&icirc;ti was the spouse of Ahura Mazda,
and Queen of the Seven,&mdash;the seven Ameshi-Spentas who preside
respectively over the seven karshvares of the earth.</p>
<p>The function of Arma&icirc;ti being to win men from nomadic life and
warfare, to foster peace and tillage, she was a type of &ldquo;the
eternal feminine&rdquo;; and such an ideal could hardly have been
developed except in a region where women were held in great honour, nor
could it fail to produce women worthy of honor. That such was the fact
in Zoroastrian Persia is proved by many passages in the Avesta, wherein
we find eminent women among the first disciples of Zoroaster. There is
a litany to the Fravashis, or ever living and working spirits, of
twenty-seven women, whose names are given in <i>Favard&icirc;n Yast</i>
(139&ndash;142). Among these was the Queen Hutaosa, converted by
Zoroaster, the wife of King V&icirc;st&acirc;spa, the Constantine of
Zoroastrianism. Hutaosa was naturally a visible and royal
representative of Arma&icirc;ti, &ldquo;Queen of the Seven,&rdquo; a
princess of peace, a patroness of culture, to be imitated by other
Persian queens.</p>
<p>That the sanctity of &ldquo;seven&rdquo; was impressed on all usages
of life in Persia is shown in the story of Esther. King Ahasuerus
feasts on the seventh day, has seven chamberlains, and consults the
seven princes of Media and Persia (&ldquo;wise men which knew the
times&rdquo;). When Esther finds favor of the King above all other
maidens, as successor to deposed Vashti, she is at once given
&ldquo;the seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the
King&rsquo;s house; and he removed her and her maidens to the best
place of the house of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href=
"#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>women.&rdquo; Esther was thus a Queen
of the Seven,&mdash;of Sheba, in Hebrew,&mdash;and although this was
some centuries after Solomon&rsquo;s time, there is every reason to
suppose that the Zoroastrian social usages in Persia prevailed in
Solomon&rsquo;s time. At any rate we find in the ancient Psalm lxxii.,
labeled &ldquo;Of Solomon,&rdquo; Kings of Sheba (the Seven) mentioned
along with the Euphrates, chief of the Seven Rivers (Zend Haptaheando);
and remembering also the &ldquo;sevens&rdquo; of Esther, we may safely
infer that a &ldquo;Queen of Sheba&rdquo; connoted a Persian or Median
Queen.</p>
<p>We may also fairly infer, from the emphasis laid on
&ldquo;sevens&rdquo; in Esther, in connexion with her wit and wisdom,
that a Queen of the Seven had come to mean a wise woman, whether of
Jewish or Persian origin, a woman instructed among the Magi, and
enjoying the freedom allowed by them to women. There is no geographical
difficulty in supposing that a Persian queen like Hutaosa, a devotee of
Arma&icirc;ti (Queen of the Seven, genius of Peace and Agriculture),
might not have heard of Salem, the City of Peace, of its king whose
title was the Peaceful (Solomon), and visited that city,&mdash;though
of course the location of the meeting may have been only a later
tradition.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1337src" href="#xd21e1337" name=
"xd21e1337src">1</a></p>
<p>The object of the Queen&rsquo;s visit to Solomon was &ldquo;to test
him with hard questions&rdquo; as to his wisdom. It was not to discover
or pay court to his wisdom, though he received from her &ldquo;of the
gold of Sheba&rdquo; spoken of in the psalm. As a royal missionary of
the Magi her ability and title to prove Solomon&rsquo;s knowledge, and
decide <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>on it, are assumed in the narrative (1 Kings x.).
Several sentences in her tribute to Solomon&rsquo;s &ldquo;wisdom and
goodness&rdquo; recall passages in the Psalm (lxxii.). There is here an
intimation of some prevailing belief that Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom was
harmonious with the Zoroastrian wisdom. Whether the visit of the Queen
be mythical or not, and even if both she and Solomon are regarded as
mythical, the legend would none the less be an expression of a popular
perception of elements not Jewish in Solomonic literature.</p>
<p>Of course only Biblical mythology is here referred to. The Moslem
mythology of Solomon and the Queen (Balkis) has taken from the Avesta
Wise King Yima&rsquo;s potent ring, and his power over demons, and
other fables, in most instances to be noted only as an unconscious
recognition of a certain general accent common to the narratives of the
two great kings. Yet it can hardly be said that the stories of Yima in
the Avesta and of Solomon in the Bible are entirely independent of each
other,&mdash;as in Yima&rsquo;s being given by the deity a sort of
choice and selecting the political career, Ahura Mazda saying:
&ldquo;Since thou wanted not to be the preacher and the bearer of my
law, then make thou my worlds thrive, make my worlds increase:
undertake thou to nourish, to rule, and to watch over my world.&rdquo;
Ahura Mazda requests Yima to build an enclosure for the preservation of
the seeds of life (men, animals, and plants) during a succession of
fatal winters, and some of the particulars resemble both the legend of
the ark and that of building the temple. Yima was, like Solomon, a
priest-king (he is also called &ldquo;the good shepherd&rdquo;); he
was, like Solomon, beset by satans (da&ecirc;vas), and after a reign of
fabulous prosperity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>he finally fell by uttering falsehood. What
the falsehood was is told in the Bundahis: the good part of creation
was ascribed to the evil creator.</p>
<p>Several other heroes of the Avesta have assisted in the idealisation
of Solomon, notably King V&icirc;st&acirc;spa, already mentioned. Like
Solomon, he is famous for his horses and his wealth. Zoroaster exhorts
him, &ldquo;All night long address the heavenly Wisdom; all night long
call for the Wisdom that will keep thee awake.&rdquo; From Zoroaster
the &ldquo;Young King&rdquo; learned &ldquo;how the worlds were
arranged&rdquo;; and he is advised &ldquo;have no bad priests or
unfriendly priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is now necessary to inquire whether there is anything
corresponding to these facts in the ancient writings ascribed to
Solomon. The lower criticism has little liking for Solomon, and makes
but a feeble struggle for the genuineness of his canonical books
against the higher criticism, which forbids us to assign any word to
Solomon. But these higher critics acquired their learning while lower
critics, and it is difficult to repress an occasional suspicion of the
survival of an unconscious prejudice against the royal secularist,
apparent in their unwillingness to admit any participation at all of
Solomon in the wisdom books. Is this quite reasonable?</p>
<p>It is of course clear that Solomon cannot be described as the author
of any book or compilation that we now possess. But neither did
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1354" title=
"Source: Boccacio">Boccaccio</span> write Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo; nor Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cymon and
Iphigenia,&rdquo; nor the apologue of the Ring in Lessing&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Nathan the Wise,&rdquo; nor Tennyson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Falcon,&rdquo; all of which, however, are his tales. I select
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1357" title=
"Source: Boccacio">Boccaccio</span> for the illustration because his
defiance of &ldquo;the moralities&rdquo; led to his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>suppression in most European homes, thus
facilitating the utilization of his ideas by others who derive credit
from his genius, this being precisely what might be expected in the
case of the great secularist of Jerusalem. For no one can carefully
study the Book of Proverbs without perceiving that a large number of
them never could have been popular proverbs, but are terse little
essays and fables, some of them highly artistic, which indicate the
presence at some remote epoch of a man of genius. And I cannot conceive
any fair reason for setting aside the tradition of many centuries which
steadily united the name of Solomon with much of this kind of writing,
or for believing that every sentence he ever uttered or wrote is
lost.</p>
<p>It would require a separate work to pick out from the two
Anthologies ascribed to Solomon (the First, Proverbs x. i&ndash;xxii.
16; the Second, xxv&ndash;xxix), the more elaborate thoughts, and piece
together those that represent one mind, even were I competent for that
work. But this fine task awaits some scholar, and, indeed, the whole
Book of Proverbs needs a more thorough treatment in this direction than
it has received.</p>
<p>Of the last seven chapters of the Book of Proverbs, one (xxx.),
containing the fragments of Agur and his angry antagonist, has been
(vii.) considered. Chapters xxv., xxvi., xxvii., and xxxi. 10&ndash;31,
may with but little elimination fairly come under their general
heading, &ldquo;These are also proverbs of Solomon which the men of
Hezekiah, King of Judah, copied out.&rdquo; Chapters xxviii. and xxix.,
with their flings at princes and wealth, contain many Jahvist
insertions. The admirable verses in xxiv. 23&ndash;34, and those in
xxxi. 10&ndash;29, 31, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>represent the high secular ethics of the
Solomonic school.</p>
<p>The verses last mentioned (exaltation of the virtuous woman) are,
curiously enough, blended with &ldquo;The words of King Lemuel, the
oracle which his mother taught him.&rdquo; The ancient Rabbins identify
Lemuel with Solomon, and relate that when, on the day of the dedication
of the temple, he married Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, he drank too much
at the wedding feast, and slept until the fourth hour of the next day,
with the keys of the temple under his pillow. Whereupon his mother,
Bathsheba, entered and reproved him with this oracle. Bathsheba&rsquo;s
own amour with Solomon&rsquo;s father does not appear to have excited
any rabbinical suspicion that the description of the virtuous wife with
which the Book of Proverbs closes is hardly characteristic of the
woman. She was the &ldquo;Queen Mother,&rdquo; a part of the divine
scheme, her conception of the builder of the temple immaculate,
predetermined in the counsels of Jahveh.</p>
<p>The first nine verses of this last chapter in the Book of Proverbs
certainly appear as if written at a later day, perhaps even so late as
the third century before our era, and aimed at the Jahvist tradition of
Solomon. Lemuel seems to be allegorical, and we here have an early
instance of the mysterious disinclination to mention the great
King&rsquo;s name. His name, Renan assures us, is hidden under
&ldquo;Koheleth,&rdquo; but he is not named in the text of that book or
even in that of the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon.&rdquo; In Ezra v. 11 the
mention of the temple as the house &ldquo;which a great king of Israel
builded and finished&rdquo; seems to indicate a purposed suppression of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>Solomon&rsquo;s name, which continued (Jeremiah
lii. 20 is barely an exception) until this silence was broken by Jesus
Ben Sira, and again by Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>The removal of verse 30 (Proverbs xxxi.), clearly a late Jahvist
protest, leaves the praise of the virtuous woman with which the book
closes without any suggestion of piety. Yet we find here that
&ldquo;her price is far above rubies,&rdquo; &ldquo;she openeth her
mouth with wisdom,&rdquo; and one or two other tropes which probably
united with some in the First Anthology to evolve more distinctly the
goddess Wisdom. Some sentences of the First Anthology grew like mustard
seed. &ldquo;Wisdom resteth in the heart of him who hath
understanding&rdquo; (Proverbs xiv. 33), reappears in 1 Kings iii. 12,
and in x. 24 it is definitely stated that it was the wisdom which God
had put into Solomon&rsquo;s heart that made all the earth seek his
presence. It was a miracle they went to see; the glory is not that of
Solomon, but that of God.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1377src" href=
"#xd21e1377" name="xd21e1377src">2</a></p>
<p>The nearest approach to a personification of Wisdom in the First
Anthology is Proverb xx. 15: &ldquo;There is gold and abundance of
pearls, but the lips of knowledge are a (more) precious jewel.&rdquo;
This expands in Job to a long list of precious things&mdash;gold,
coral, topaz, pearls&mdash;all surpassed by Wisdom, and the similitudes
journey on to the parables of Jesus, wherein the woman sweeps for the
lost silver, and the man sells all he has for the pearl of price. This,
however, was a comparatively <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>simple and human development. And the
first complete personification of Wisdom, growing out of &ldquo;the
lips of knowledge,&rdquo; and perhaps influenced by the portraiture of
&ldquo;the virtuous woman,&rdquo; is an expression of philosophical and
poetic religion. This personification is in Proverbs viii. and ix.,
which are evidently far more ancient than the seven chapters preceding
them, and no doubt constitute the original editorial Prologue to the
so-called &ldquo;Proverbs of Solomon,&rdquo; with the exception of some
Jahvist cant about &ldquo;the fear of Jahveh.&rdquo; We hear from
&ldquo;the lips of knowledge&rdquo; a reaffirmation of the
&ldquo;excellent things&rdquo; said in the Anthologies about the
superiority of Wisdom to gems. (The word &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; given by
the revisers in the margin to viii. 18 may possibly signify the
antiquity of the Anthologies when this Prologue was written.) The
scholarly writer of the Prologue had closely studied the ancient
proverbs, and occasionally gives good hints for the interpretation of
some that puzzle modern translators. Thus Wisdom, in describing herself
as &ldquo;sporting&rdquo; (viii. 30), indicates the right meaning of x.
23 to be that while the fool finds his sport in mischief, the wise man
finds his sport with wisdom. (This proverb may also have suggested the
laughter of the &ldquo;virtuous woman&rdquo; in xxxi. 25.)</p>
<p>In viii. 22&ndash;31, Wisdom becomes more than a personification,
and takes her place in cosmogony. This passage, which contains germs of
much of our latter-day theology, must be quoted in full, and
comparatively studied. Wisdom speaks:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">22. Jahveh acquired me in the outset of his way,<br>
Before his works, from of old.</p>
<p>23. From eternity was I existent,<br>
From the first, before the earth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"
href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>24. When no deep seas I was brought forward,<br>
When no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p>25. Before the mountains were fixed,<br>
Before the hills, was I brought forward:</p>
<p>26. When he had not fashioned the earth and the fields,<br>
And the consummate part of the dust of the world.</p>
<p>27. When he established the heavens, I was there;<br>
When he set a boundary on the face of the deep;</p>
<p>28. When he made firm the clouds above;<br>
When the fountains of the deep became strong;</p>
<p>29. When he gave to the sea its limit,<br>
That the waters should not pass over their coast;<br>
When he marked out the foundation pillars of the earth:</p>
<p>30. Then was I near him, as a master builder:<br>
And I was his delight continually,<br>
Sporting before him at all times;</p>
<p>31. Sporting in the habitable part of his earth,<br>
And my delight was with the sons of men.</p>
</div>
<p>Let us compare with this picture of Wisdom that of Arma&icirc;ti,
genius of the Earth, in the sacred Zoroastrian books. In the
G&acirc;tha Ahunavaiti, 7, it is said: &ldquo;To succor this life (to
increase it) Arma&icirc;ti came with wealth, and good and true mind:
she, the everlasting one, created the material world; but the soul, as
to time, the first cause among created beings, was with thee&rdquo;
(Ahura Mazda). Thus, like Wisdom, Arma&icirc;ti is everlasting: she was
not created, but &ldquo;acquired,&rdquo; by the deity. When Ahura
Mazda, as chief of the seven Amesha-spentas, ideally designed the
world, she gave it reality, as master-builder, and, like Wisdom, hewed
out the foundation pillars he had marked out,&mdash;namely, the Seven
Karshvares of the earth. The opening lines of Proverbs ix. read almost
like a quotation from some G&acirc;tha:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Wisdom hath builded her house,</p>
<p class="line">She hath hewn out her seven pillars.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like Wisdom, Arma&icirc;ti was the continual delight of the supreme
God. In an ancient P&acirc;li MS., it is said that Zoroaster saw the
supreme being in heaven, with Arma&icirc;ti seated at his side, her
hand caressing his neck, and said: &ldquo;Thou, who art Ahura Mazda,
turnest not thy eyes away from her, and she turns not away from
thee.&rdquo; Ahura Mazda tells Zoroaster that she is &ldquo;the house
mistress of my heaven, and mother of the creatures.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1449src" href="#xd21e1449" name="xd21e1449src">3</a>
Like Wisdom, Arma&icirc;ti has joy in the &ldquo;habitable part&rdquo;
of the earth, and the &ldquo;sons of men,&rdquo; from whom she receives
especial delight (&ldquo;the greatest joy&rdquo;), are enumerated in
the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d, also the places in which she has such
delight. They are the faithful who cultivate the earth morally and
physically, and the places so watered or drained, and homes &ldquo;with
wife, children, and good herds within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arma&icirc;ti has a daughter, &ldquo;the good Ashi,&rdquo; whose
function is to pass between earth and heaven and bring the heavenly
wisdom (Vohu-Mano, &ldquo;Good Thought&rdquo;) to mankind. The soul of
the world thus reaches, and is reached by, heaven, and Arma&icirc;ti
thus becomes a personification of the combined human and superhuman
Wisdom ascribed to great men, such as Solomon. At the same time the
&ldquo;sons of men&rdquo; are all the children of Arma&icirc;ti, and
she finds delight among them. Even the rudest are restrained by her
culture. &ldquo;By the eyes of Arma&icirc;ti the (demonic) ruffian was
made powerless,&rdquo; says Zoroaster. The spirit of the Earth,
laughing with her flowers and fruits, survived in Persia the sombre
reign of Islam, to sing in the quatrain of Omar Khayy&aacute;m:
&ldquo;I asked my fair bride&mdash;the World&mdash;what was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>her dower: she answered, &lsquo;My dower is in the
joy of thy heart.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sons of men&rdquo; is not an Avestan phrase, for to
Arma&icirc;ti her daughters are as dear as her sons, but we find in the
Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d &ldquo;the seeds of men and women.&rdquo; These
are sprung from those who were selected for preservation in the Vara,
or enclosure, of the first man, Yimi, made by direction of the deity,
when the evil powers brought fatal winters on the world. The deformed,
diseased, wicked, were excluded; the chosen people were those formed of
&ldquo;the best of the earth.&rdquo; From long and prosperous life on
earth, the Amesha of immortality, the good angel of death, conducted
them to eternal happiness; they are the immortals, children of the
demons being mortals. There was something corresponding to this in the
Jewish idea of their being a chosen people, as distinguished from the
Gentile world (see Deut. xxxii. 8), and no doubt the phrase &ldquo;sons
of men&rdquo; represented a divine dignity afterwards expressed in the
title, &ldquo;Son of Man.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1461src"
href="#xd21e1461" name="xd21e1461src">4</a></p>
<p>The Solomonic hymn of Wisdom at the creation (Proverbs viii.
22&ndash;31) contains other Avestan phrases. &ldquo;From eternity was I
existent,&rdquo; recalls Zervan akarana, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>&ldquo;boundless
time,&rdquo; and verse 26, relating to the earth, is still more
significant: in it &ldquo;the sum&rdquo; has been suggested by the
Revisers for (E. V.) &ldquo;the highest part&rdquo; (of the earth), but
in either rendering it is near to the Avestan phrase, &ldquo;the best
of Arma&icirc;ti&rdquo; (Earth). This phrase is reproduced in the
Bundahis (xv. 6), where the creator, Ahura Mazda, says to the first
pair, &ldquo;You are men (cf. Genesis v. 2, he &lsquo;called their name
Adam&rsquo;), you are the ancestry of the world, and you are created
the best of Arma&icirc;ti (the Earth) by me.&rdquo; (West&rsquo;s
translation. <i>Sacred Books of the East</i>. Vol. V., p. 54, n. 2.)
The word for Earth in Proverb 26 is <i>adamah</i>, and in the
Septuagint (various reading) it is actually translated <span class=
"trans" title="Armaith"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Alpha;&rho;&mu;&alpha;&iota;&theta;</span></span>,&mdash;Arma&icirc;ti&rsquo;s
very name. We may thus find in Proverb 26 (viii.) the idea of Omar
Khayy&aacute;m, &ldquo;Man is the whole creation&rsquo;s
summary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether there is any connexion between the Sanskrit <i>Adima</i> and
Hebrew Adam is still under philological discussion: probably not, for
their meaning is different, Adima meaning &ldquo;the first,&rdquo; and
Adam relating to the material out of which he is said to have been
formed. Adam is derived from Adamah: after all, man came from the great
Woman&mdash;&ldquo;the Mother of all living.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1487src" href="#xd21e1487" name="xd21e1487src">5</a> Adamah,
according to Sale, is a Persian word meaning &ldquo;red earth,&rdquo;
and in Hebrew also it connotes redness. Arma&icirc;ti might have
acquired an epithet of ruddiness from her union with &Acirc;tar, the
genius of Fire (Fargard xviii. 51, 52. Darmesteter. Introduction, iv.
30). In Hebrew <i>adamah</i> combines three senses&mdash;a fortress,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>redness, and cultivated ground. In Proverbs (viii.
31) we have the fortress or enclosure, &ldquo;the habitable part of his
earth&rdquo;; in verse 26 the cultivated earth, &ldquo;the highest part
(or sum, or best) of the dust of the earth.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;delight&rdquo; in which Wisdom dwelt (verse 30) is Eden, the
garden of delight, and in verse 31 this delight associated with the
human children of the earth. Here we have the elements of the narrative
of the creation of Adam in Genesis, and of the garden, though clearly
not derived from Genesis. And in Genesis we find something like a
personification of the earth, as in ix. 13, &ldquo;It (the rainbow)
shall be a token of a covenant between me and the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of a creative deity requiring, as in Proverbs viii., the
assistance of another personal being, is foreign to Jahvism, but it is
of the very substance of Zoroastrianism, and it reappears in the
Elohism of Genesis. Another important and fundamental fact is, that we
find in the prologue to Proverbs a deity contending against something,
circumscribing forces that need control, not of his creation. It is
plain that the conception of monotheistic omnipotence had not yet been
formed. There are higher and lower parts of the earth.</p>
<p>Although there is no evidence that any such compilation as our
&ldquo;Genesis&rdquo; existed at the time when the prologue (viii.,
ix.) to the &ldquo;Proverbs of Solomon&rdquo; was composed, the
Elohistic opening of Genesis, especially in its original form,
harmonises with the Parsi conflict between Light and Darkness.</p>

earth&mdash;when the earth was desolation and emptiness&mdash;darkness
on the face <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=

</div>
<p>The spirit of God &ldquo;brooding&rdquo; over the waters (Genesis i.
1) may be identified with the Wisdom of Proverbs ix. 1, who
&ldquo;builds her house&rdquo; as the Elohim built the universe, and
&ldquo;hath hewn out her seven pillars&rdquo; like a true
Arma&icirc;ti, &ldquo;Queen of the Seven.&rdquo; She is the Spirit of
Light. And perhaps the darkness that was on the face of the abyss
suggested the antagonistic personification in the next chapter (ix.)
named by Professor Cheyne &ldquo;Dame Folly.&rdquo; Wisdom, having
builded her house, spread her table, mingled her wine, sends forth her
maidens to invite the simple to forsake Folly, enjoy her feast, and
&ldquo;live.&rdquo; Dame Folly,&mdash;who though she has &ldquo;a seat
in high places&rdquo; is &ldquo;silly,&rdquo;&mdash;clamours to every
wayfarer that even the bread and water of her table, being
surreptitious, are sweeter than the luxuries and wine offered by
Wisdom. This appears to be the meaning of Dame Folly&rsquo;s somewhat
obscure invitation.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;&lsquo;Waters stolen are sweet!</p>
<p class="line">Forbidden bread is pleasant!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">He knoweth not her phantoms are there,</p>
<p class="line">That her guests are in the underworld.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>In this contrast between Wisdom inviting all to enter her house,
drink her wine, and &ldquo;live,&rdquo; and Folly inviting them to her
&ldquo;Sheol,&rdquo; we have nearly a quatrain of Omar Khayy&aacute;m:
&ldquo;Since from the beginning of life to its end there is for thee
only this earth, at least live as one who is on it and not under
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Avesta the good and wise Mother Earth (Arma&icirc;ti) is
opposed by a malign female &ldquo;Drug&rdquo; (demoness), whose
paramours are described in Fargard xviii. (Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d). These
two are fairly represented by Wisdom and Folly as personified in
Proverbs viii. and ix.</p>
<p>The Jahvist who in Proverbs i. 1&ndash;7 (excepting the first six
verses) undertakes to edit the original and ancient editor as well as
Solomon, presents the curious case of one of Dame Folly&rsquo;s
phantoms interpreting the words of Wisdom&rsquo;s guests. Unable to
comprehend their portraiture of Dame Folly, he imagines that the
allusion must be to harlotry, admonishes his &ldquo;son&rdquo; that
&ldquo;Jahveh giveth wisdom,&rdquo; which among other things will
&ldquo;deliver thee from the strange woman,&rdquo; whose &ldquo;house
sinketh down to the underworld and her paths unto phantoms.&rdquo;
Which recalls the pious lady who on hearing her ritualistic pastor
accused by a dissenter of leanings toward the Scarlet Woman, anxiously
inquired of a friend whether she had ever heard any scandal connected
with their vicar&rsquo;s name!</p>
<p>Our Jahvist editor seems to be one who would often say of laughter
&ldquo;it is mad&rdquo;; and naturally could not imagine how Wisdom
could &ldquo;sport&rdquo; before the Lord (viii. 30) unless she were in
some sense mad. The sport before Jahveh could only be in mockery of
some sinner&rsquo;s torment, like the derision ascribed to Jahveh
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>(Psalm ii. 4); consequently our editor represents
Wisdom crying abroad in the streets:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Because I have called and ye
refused....</p>
<p class="line">I also will laugh in the day of your calamity,</p>
<p class="line">I will mock when your fear cometh.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But Pliny mentions the Mazdean belief, confirmed by
Parsi tradition, that Zoroaster was born laughing. To him Ahura Mazda
says: &ldquo;Do thou proclaim, O pure Zoroaster, the vigor, the glory,
the help and the joy that are in the Fravashis (souls) of the
faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, we may see in these first seven chapters of Proverbs that
Wisdom had become detached from the sons of men, in whom she had once
found delight, was no longer in the human heart, but had finally
ascended to wield the heavenly thunderbolts. And yet it is probable
that we owe to this vindictive and menacing attitude of deified Wisdom
the preservation of so many witty and sceptical things in books
traditionally ascribed to Solomon. The orthodox legend being that the
Lord had put supernatural wisdom into Solomon&rsquo;s heart, and never
revoked it despite his &ldquo;idolatry&rdquo; and secularism, it
followed that the naughty man could not help continuing to be a medium
of this divine person, Wisdom, and that it might be a dangerous thing
to suppress any utterance of hers through Solomon,&mdash;unwitting
blasphemy. However profane or worldly the writings might appear to the
Jahvist mind, there was no knowing what occult inspiration there might
be in them, and the only thing editors could venture was to sprinkle
through them plenteous disinfectants in the way of
&ldquo;Fear-of-the-Lord&rdquo; wisdom.</p>
<p>The proverbs in which the name Jahveh appears are not, of course, to
be indiscriminately rejected as entirely <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>Jahvist interpolations.
It seems probable that little more than the word Jahveh has been
supplied in some of these,&mdash;e. g., xix. 3, xx. 27, xxi. 1, 3,
xxviii. 5, xxix. 26. But in a majority of cases the proverbs containing
the name Jahveh are ethically and radically inharmonious with the
substance and spirit of the book as a whole, which is founded on the
supremacy of human &ldquo;merits&rdquo; as fully as Zoroastrianism, in
which salvation depends absolutely on Good Thought, Good Word, Good
Deed. In dynamic monotheism (as distinguished from ethical) of which
Jahvism is the ancient and Islam the modern type, the doctrine of human
&ldquo;merits&rdquo; is inadmissible: a man&rsquo;s virtues are not his
own, and in Jahveh&rsquo;s sight they are but &ldquo;filthy
rags,&rdquo; except so far as they are given by Jahveh. But in the
Solomonic proverbs the highest virtues, and the supreme blessings of
the universe, are obtained by a man&rsquo;s own wisdom, character, and
deeds. And in some cases the claims for Jahveh appear to have been
inserted as if in answer or retort to proverbs ignoring the
participation of any deity in such high matters. I quote a few
instances, in which the antithesis turns to antagonism:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Solomon&mdash;By kindness and truth iniquity is atoned

inserted for the correction of preceding ones,&mdash;these being not

"noteref" id="xd21e1697src" href="#xd21e1697" name="xd21e1697src">7</a>
and Jesus; and it was left to Paul to recover the Jahvist modifications
of Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom in order to adulterate for hard Romans the
humane spirit of Jesus (Romans xii. 19, 20). The Solomonic sentences
are normally so magnanimous as to throw suspicion on any clause tainted
with smallness or vulgarity. The pervading spirit is, &ldquo;The
benevolent heart shall be enriched, and he who watereth shall himself
be watered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is one proverb (xiv. 32) which suggests a belief in
immortality, or possibly in the Angel of Death:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">By his evil deeds the evil man is thrust downward,</p>
<p class="line">But the virtuous man hath confidence in his death.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">According to the Avesta every man is born with an
invisible noose around his neck. When a good man dies the noose falls,
and he passes to a beautiful region where he is met by a maid, to whom
he says, &ldquo;Who art thou, who art the fairest I have ever
seen?&rdquo; She <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>answers, &ldquo;O thou of good thoughts, good
words, good deeds, I am thy actions.&rdquo; The evil man meets a
leprous hag, embodiment of his actions, who by his noose drags him down
through the evil-thought hell, the evil-word hell, the evil-deed hell,
to the region of &ldquo;Endless Darkness&rdquo; (Yast xxii.). This
darkness may be metaphorically spoken of in Proverbs xx. 20:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He that curseth his father and mother,</p>
<p class="line">His lamp shall be put out in the blackest darkness.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But generally the allusions to death in the Solomonic
proverbs do not seem to allude to physical death. In x. 2 &ldquo;virtue
delivereth from death&rdquo; is in antithesis to the unprofitableness
of evil treasures, and in 16:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The reward of a virtuous man is life;</p>
<p class="line">The gain of the wicked is sin.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here &ldquo;life&rdquo; and &ldquo;sin&rdquo; are in

<p class="line">The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,</p>

Jahvist xiv. 27.)</p>
<p class="line">Understanding is a fountain of life to those who
possess it,</p>
<p class="line">But the snare of fools is Folly. (xvi. 22.)</p>
<p class="line">He that hateth reproof shall die. (xv. 10.)</p>

to &ldquo;life,&rdquo; unless the pronoun be cancelled altogether.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=

<p>The two proverbs last quoted may be usefully compared with the
ancient Prologue (viii. ix.) already referred to in this chapter, as
they are there reproduced pictorially in Wisdom and Dame Folly sitting
at their respective doors. Wisdom offers long life and happiness:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">But he who wandereth from me doeth violence to his own
life,</p>
<p class="line">All who hate me love death. (viii. 36.)</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Dame Folly tries to turn into her by-path those who
are &ldquo;proceeding straight in their course&rdquo; (ix. 15), but her
victim&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He knoweth not her phantoms are there,</p>
<p class="line">That her guests are in the underworld. (ix. 18.)</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The same Hebrew word <i>Rephaim</i> (phantoms or
shades) is used here and in xxi. 16.</p>
<p>All of these references to death and the underworld (<i>sheol</i>),
except perhaps xiv. 32, refer to the living death, moral and spiritual,
which is of such vast and fundamental significance in Zoroastrian
religion. In this religion the evil power is &ldquo;all death.&rdquo;
The universe is divided by and into &ldquo;the living and the not
living.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1792src" href="#xd21e1792"
name="xd21e1792src">8</a> &ldquo;When these two Spirits came together
they made first Life and Death,&rdquo;&mdash;words sometimes used as
synonymous with the &ldquo;Good and the Evil Mind.&rdquo; Ahura Mazda
representing all the forces that work for health and life, Angromainyu
(Ahriman) all that work for disease and destruction, have ranged with
them all animals and plants, on one side or the other, in this great
conflict. The life of an Ahrimanian creature is &ldquo;incarnate
death.&rdquo; (Darmesteter&rsquo;s Introduction to the
Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span>v. 11.) His destructiveness is equally
against virtue, wisdom, peace, health, happiness, life, and all of
these, not merely physical dissolution, are included in his Avestan
title, &ldquo;The Fiend who is all death.&rdquo; He is the Abaddon of
Revelation ix. 11, also he &ldquo;that had the power of death&rdquo; in
Hebrews ii. 14, and probably came into both of these from Proverbs
xxvii. 20:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied,</p>
<p class="line">And the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Dr. Inman (<i>Ancient Faiths</i>, i., p. 180) connects
Abaddon with &ldquo;Abadan (cuneiform), the lost one, the sun in
winter, or darkness,&rdquo; which conforms with the Avestan Ahriman,
who is emphatically a winter-demon, his hell being in the north (cf.
Jeremiah i. 14 and elsewhere), and is the natural adversary of the
Fire-worshipper.</p>
<p>Among the Zoroastrians there were not only Towers of Silence
(Dakhma) for the literally dead, but also for the confinement of those
tainted by carrying corpses, or by any contact with the
death-fiend&rsquo;s empire, such as being struck with temporary death.
&ldquo;The unclean,&rdquo; says Darmesteter, &ldquo;are confined in a
particular place, apart from all clean persons and objects, the
Arm&ecirc;st-g&acirc;h, which may be described, therefore, as the
Dakhma for the living.&rdquo; Here then are the dead-alive guests of
Dame Folly (Proverbs ix. 15), who opposes Wisdom, as Ahriman created
Akem-Mano (evil thought) to oppose Vohu-Mano (good thought), and here
is the assembly that might give the Solomonic proverb its metaphor:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The man who wandereth from the way of instruction</p>
<p class="line">Shall rest in the congregation of the phantoms (or
shades, <i>Rephaim</i>).</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Zoroastrian books from which I have been quoting contain
passages of very unequal date, but it is the opinion of Avestan
scholars that most of them are from very ancient sources,
pre-Solomonic, and there is no chronological difficulty in supposing
that such institutions as the Arm&ecirc;st-g&acirc;h, for the
separation of the unclean, should not have been well known in ancient
Jerusalem before the corresponding levitical laws concerning the
unclean and the leprous existed.</p>
<p>The Book of Proverbs was also a growth, and although, as has been
stated, there is reason to regard as later additions most of the
proverbs containing the word Jahveh, as they are inconsistent with the
general ethical tenor of the book, there are several in which that name
is evidently out of place. Even in the editorial Prologue we can hardly
recognize orthodox Jahvism in the conception of a being, Wisdom, not
created by Jahveh yet giving him delight and some kind of assistance at
the creation; and nowhere else in the Old Testament do we find such an
idea as that of xx. 27, &ldquo;The spirit of a man is Jahveh&rsquo;s
lamp,&rdquo; or in xix. 17:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He who is kind to the poor lendeth to Jahveh,</p>
<p class="line">And his good deed shall be recompensed to him.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But in the Zoroastrian religion men and women render
assistance and encouragement to the gods, and we find the chief deity,
Ahura Mazda, saying to Zoroaster concerning the Fravashis, or souls, of
holy men and women: &ldquo;Do thou proclaim, O pure Zoroaster, the
vigor and strength, the glory, the help and the joy, that are in the
Fravashis of the faithful ... do thou tell how they came to help me,
how they bring assistance unto me.... Through their brightness and
glory, O Zoroaster, I maintain that sky there above.&rdquo;
Favard&icirc;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>Yast, 1, 2.) As Frederick the Great said, &ldquo;a
king is the chief of subjects,&rdquo; so with Zoroaster Ahura Mazda is
the chief of the faithful; or, as Luther said, &ldquo;God is strong,
but he likes to be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The similitude in Proverbs xx. 27 is especially important in our
inquiry:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The spirit of man is the lamp of Jahveh,</p>
<p class="line">Searching all the chambers of the body.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The word for &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; here is
<i>Nishma</i>, which occurs in but one other instance in the Bible,
namely, in Job xxvi. 4. Job asks:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">To whom hast thou uttered words?</p>
<p class="line">And whose spirit came forth from thee?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This chapter of Job (xxvi.) is closely related to
Proverbs viii. and ix., both in thought and phraseology: the Rephaim,
or phantoms, the &ldquo;pillars,&rdquo; the ordering of earth and
clouds, the boundary on the deep; and there is an allusion to
&ldquo;the confines of Light and Darkness,&rdquo; which point to the
domains of Wisdom and Dame Folly. Job and the proverbialist surely got
these ideas from the same source, and also the word <i>nishma</i>,
translated &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; which throughout the Old Testament is
<i>ruach</i>, save in the two texts indicated. But there is no text in
the Bible where <i>ruach</i>, spirit, or soul, is associated with light
like the <i>nishma</i> of the proverb, and in Job <i>nishma</i>
evidently means a superhuman spirit. Now there is a Chaldean word,
<i>nisma</i>, which in the Persian <span class="corr" id="xd21e1873"
title="Source: Boundahis">Bundahis</span> appears as
<i>nism&ocirc;</i>, and is translated by West, &ldquo;living
soul.&rdquo; The ordinary word for soul in the Parsi scriptures seems
to be <i>r&ucirc;b&acirc;n</i>, and West regards the two words as
meaning the same thing, the breath, or soul, basing this on the
following passage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86"
name="pb86">86</a>]</span>of the Bundahis, representing the separation
of the first mortal into the first human pair, M&acirc;shya and
M&acirc;shyoi:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And the waists of both were brought close, and
so connected together that it was not clear which is the male and which
the female, and which is the one whose living soul (nism&ocirc;) of
A&ucirc;harmazd (God) is not away (lacking). As it is said thus:
&lsquo;Which is created before, the soul (nism&ocirc;) or the body? And
A&ucirc;harmazd said that the soul is created before, and the body
after, for him who was created; it is given unto the body to produce
activity, and the body is created only for activity; hence the
conclusion is this, that the soul (r&ucirc;b&acirc;n) is created before
and the body after. And both of them changed from the shape of a plant
into the shape of man, and the breath (nism&ocirc;) went spiritually
into them, which is the soul (r&ucirc;b&acirc;n).&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1887src" href="#xd21e1887" name=
"xd21e1887src">9</a></p>
</div>
<p>With all deference to the learned translator, I cannot think his
exegesis here quite satisfactory. In the first sentence
<i>nism&ocirc;</i> is the breath of God; and although in the second the
same word is used for the human soul, the writer seems to have aimed in
the last sentence at a distinction: the divine breath or spirit
(nism&ocirc;) creates a soul (r&ucirc;b&acirc;n), to receive which the
plant is transformed into a body fitted for the &ldquo;activity&rdquo;
of an imbreathed soul. West twice translates <i>nism&ocirc;</i>
&ldquo;living soul,&rdquo; but <i>r&ucirc;b&acirc;n</i> only
&ldquo;soul.&rdquo; Does not this indicate Ahura Mazda as the source of
divine life, as in Genesis ii. 7, where Jahveh-Elohim breathes into
man, who becomes a &ldquo;living soul,&rdquo;&mdash;a being within the
domain of the god of life, not subject to the god of death? Is it not
his <i>r&ucirc;b&acirc;n</i> that is the image of <i>nism&ocirc;</i>?
(Cf. Genesis ix. 5, 6.)</p>
<p>Turning now to the Avesta, we find the famous Favardin Yast, a
collection of litanies and ascriptions to the Fravashis. &ldquo;The
Fravashi,&rdquo; says Darmesteter, &ldquo;is the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>inner
power in every being that maintains it and makes it grow and subsist.
Originally the Fravashis were the same as the Pitris of the Hindus or
the Manes of the Latins, that is to say, the everlasting and deified
souls of the dead; but in course of time they gained a wider domain,
and not only men, but gods and even physical objects, like the sky and
the earth, had each a Fravashi.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fravashi was
independent of the circumstances of life or death, an immortal part of
the individual which existed before man and outlived him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Yast xxii. 39, 40, it is said: &ldquo;O Maker, how do the souls
of the dead, the Fravashis of the holy Ones, manifest
themselves?&rdquo; Ahura Mazda answered: &ldquo;They manifest
themselves from goodness of spirit and excellence of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Favardin Yast, 9: &ldquo;Through their brightness and glory, O
Zarathrustra, I maintain the wide earth,&rdquo; etc. 12: &ldquo;Had not
the awful Fravashis of the faithful given help unto me, those animals
and men of mine, of which there are such excellent kinds, would not
subsist; strength would belong to the fiend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other verses these Fravashis (the word means
&ldquo;protectors&rdquo;) help the children unborn, nourish health,
develop the wise. The imagery relating to them is largely related to
the stars, of which many are guardians. These are probably the origin
of the Solomonic similitude of reason, &ldquo;The spirit (nishma) of
man is the lamp of&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all of these correspondences between the Solomonic proverbs,
nothing is more remarkable than their originality, so far as any
ancient scriptures are concerned. While they are totally different from
the Psalms, in showing man as a citizen of the world, relying
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>on himself and those around him for happiness, and
exalting nothing above human virtue and intelligence, without any
religious fervor or wrath, the proverbialist is equally far from the
ethical superstitions of Zoroastrian religion, which abounds in
fictitious &ldquo;merits&rdquo; and anathematises fictitious
immoralities. It is as if some sublime Eastern pedlar and banker of
ethical and poetic gems, who had come in contact with Oriental
literatures, had separated from their liturgies and prophecies the
nuggets of gold and the precious stones, polishing, resetting, and
exciting others to do the like. At the same time many of the sentences
are the expressions of an original mind, a man of letters, neither
Eastern nor Oriental, and these may be labelled with the line of the
Persian poet Faizi: &ldquo;Take Faizi&rsquo;s D&iacute;w&aacute;n to
bear witness to the wonderful speeches of a freethinker who belongs to
a thousand sects.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=

the cultured Jews, just before our era, there was a recognition of the
equality of men, as is seen in the Wisdom of Solomon vii. 1, &ldquo;I
myself am a mortal man, like to all, and the offspring of him that was
first made of the earth.&rdquo; Solomon ascribes his superiority only
to the divine gift of wisdom. This idea of human equality was in the
preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. iii. 9)&mdash;probably a Parsi
heretic, at any rate an apostle of purifying water and fire&mdash;and
it underlay the title of Jesus, &ldquo;Son of Man.&rdquo; That in
Arma&icirc;ti there was a conception of a humanity not represented by
race but by character and culture will appear by a comparison with the
Vedic Aramati, a bride of Agni (Fire) to whom she is mythologically
related, on the one hand, and on the other to the spirit of the earth
who came to the assistance of Buddha. This story, related in many
forms, is that when the evil M&acirc;ra, having tempted Buddha in vain,
brought his hosts to terrify him, all friends forsook him, and no angel
came to help him, but the spirit of the earth, which he had watered,
arose as a fair woman, who from her long hair wrung out the water
Buddha had bestowed which became a flood and swept away the evil host.
Watering the Earth is especially mentioned in the Avesta as that which
makes her rejoice, and marks the holy man.</p>

the legend in Genesis ii. the &ldquo;rib&rdquo; is a misunderstanding.
Eve (Chavah) was the female side of Adam, which was the name of both
male and female (Gen. v. 2). The &ldquo;rib&rdquo; story arose no doubt
from the supposition that Adam&rsquo;s allusion to &ldquo;bone of my
bone&rdquo; had something to do with it. But Adam&rsquo;s phrase is an
idiom meaning only &ldquo;Thou art the same as I am.&rdquo; (Max

raven and the dove sent out of the ark by Noah, but this account only
indicates the origin of the story of the Deluge; for the raven was in
Persia an emblem of victory, and in the Biblical legend it was the only
living creature that defied the Deluge and was able to do without the
ark. In the corresponding legend in the Avesta, where King Yima makes
an enclosure (Vara) for the shelter of the seeds of all living
creatures, the heavenly bird Karshipta brings into that refuge the law
of Ahura Mazda, and as the song of this bird was the voice of Ahura
Mazda, it may have been an idealised dove</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter IX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Song of Songs.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The praise of the virtuous woman, at the close of the
Proverbs, is given a Jahvist turn by verse 30: &ldquo;Favour is
deceitful and beauty vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall
be praised.&rdquo; But the Solomonists also had their ideas of the
virtuous woman, and of beauty, these being beautifully expressed in a
series of dramatic idylls entitled The Song of Songs. To this latter,
in the original title, is added, &ldquo;which is
Solomon&rsquo;s&rdquo;; and it confirms what has been said concerning
the superstitious awe of everything proceeding from Solomon, and the
dread of insulting the Holy Spirit of Wisdom supernaturally lodged in
him, that we find in the Bible these passionate love songs. And indeed
Solomon must have been superlatively wise to have written poems in
which his greatness is slightly ridiculed. That of course would be by
no means incredible in a man of genuine wisdom&mdash;on the contrary
would be characteristic&mdash;if other conditions were met by the
tradition of his authorship.</p>
<p>At the outset, however, we are confronted by the question whether
the Song of Songs has any general coherency or dramatic character at
all. Several modern critics of learning, among them Prof. Karl Budde
and the late Edward Reuss, find the book a collection of unconnected
lyrics, and Professor Cornill of K&ouml;nigsberg <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>has
added the great weight of his name to that opinion (<i lang=
"de">Einleitung in das Alte Testament</i>. 1891). Unfortunately
Professor Cornill&rsquo;s treatment is brief, and not accompanied by a
complete analysis of the book. He favors as a principle Reuss&rsquo;s
division of Canticles into separate idylls, and thinks most readers
import into this collection of songs an imaginary system and
significance. This is certainly true of the &ldquo;allegorical&rdquo;
purport, aim, and religious ideas ascribed to the book, but Professor
Cornill&rsquo;s reference to Herder seems to leave the door open for
further treatment of the Song of Songs from a purely literary
standpoint. He praises Herder&rsquo;s discernment in describing the
book as a string of pearls, but passes without criticism or denial
Herder&rsquo;s further view that there are indications of editorial
modifications of some of the lyrics. For what purpose? Herder also
pointed out that various individualities and conditions are
represented. This indeed appears undeniable: here are prince and
shepherd, the tender mother, the cruel brothers, the rough watchman,
the dancer, the bride and bridegroom. The <i lang="la">dramatis
person&aelig;</i> are certainly present: but is there any drama?</p>
<p>Admitting that there was no ancient Hebrew theatre, the question
remains whether among the later Hellenic Jews the old songs were not
arranged, and new ones added, in some kind of <i lang=
"de">Singspiele</i> or vaudeville. There seems to be a chorus. It is
hardly consistent with the general artistic quality of the compilation
that the lady should say &ldquo;I am swarthy <i>but comely</i>,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;I am a lily of the valley&rdquo; (a gorgeous flower). Surely
the compliments are ejaculations of the chorus. And may we not ascribe
to a chorus the questions, &ldquo;Who <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>is this that cometh up
out of the wilderness?&rdquo; etc. (iii. 6&ndash;10.) &ldquo;What is
thy beloved more than another beloved&rdquo;? (v. 9.) &ldquo;Who is
this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning on her beloved&rdquo;?
(viii. 5).</p>
<p>As in the modern <i>vaudeville</i> songs are often introduced
without any special relation to the play, so we find in Canticles some
songs that might be transposed from one chapter to another without
marring the work, but is this the case with all of them? The song in
the first chapter, for instance, in which the damsel, brought by the
King into his palace, tells the ladies of the home she left, and of
maltreatment by her brothers, who took her from her own vineyard and
made her work in theirs, where she was sunburnt,&mdash;this could not
be placed effectively at the end of the book, nor the triumphant line,
&ldquo;My vineyard, which is mine own, is before me,&rdquo; be set at
the beginning. This is but one of several instances that might be
quoted. Even pearls may be strung with definite purpose, as in a
rosary, and how perfectly set is the great rose,&mdash;the hymn to Love
in the final chapter! Or to remember Professor Cornill&rsquo;s word
<i lang="de">Scenenwechsel</i>, along with his affirmation that the
love of human lovers is the burden of the &ldquo;unrivalled&rdquo;
book, there are some sequences and contrasts which do convey an
impression of dissolving views, and occasionally reveal a connexion
between separate tableaux. For example the same words (which I
conjecture to be those of a chorus) are used to introduce Solomon in
pompous palanquin with grand escort, that are presently used to greet
the united lovers.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Who is this that cometh up from the
wilderness like pillars of smoke?&rdquo; (iii. 6.)</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Who is this that cometh up from the
wilderness</p>
<p class="line">Leaning on her beloved?&rdquo; (viii. 5.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>These are five chapters apart, yet surely they may be supposed
connected without <i lang="de">Hineininterpretation</i>. Any single
contrast of this kind might be supposed a mere coincidence, but there
are two others drawn between the swarthy maiden and the monarch. The
tableau of Solomon in his splendor dissolves into another of his Queen
Mother crowning him on the day of his espousal: that of Shulamith
leaning on her beloved dissolves into another of <i>her</i> mother
pledging her to her lover in espousals under an apple tree. And then we
find (viii. 11, 12) Solomon&rsquo;s distant vineyards tended by many
hirelings contrasted with Shulamith&rsquo;s own little vineyard tended
by herself.</p>
<p>The theory that the book is a collection of bridal songs, and that
the mention of Solomon is due to an eastern custom of designating the
bridegroom and bride as Solomon and Queen Shulamith, during their
honeymoon, does not seem consistent with the fact that in several
allusions to Solomon his royal state is slighted, whereas only
compliments would be paid to a bridegroom. Moreover the
two&mdash;Shulamith and Solomon&mdash;are not as persons named
together. It will, I think, appear as we proceed that the Shelomoh
(Solomon) of Canticles represents a conventionalisation of the monarch,
with some traits not found in any other book in the Bible. A verse near
the close, presently considered, suggests that the bride and bridegroom
are at that one point metaphorically pictured as a Solomon and
Solomona, indicating one feature of the Wise Man&rsquo;s
conventionalization.</p>
<p>Renan assigned Canticles the date B. C. 992&ndash;952, mainly
because in it Tirza is coupled with Jerusalem. Tirza was a capital only
during those years, and at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>any later period was too
insignificant a town to be spoken of as in the Song vi. 4:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Thou art beautiful, O my love, as
Tirzah,</p>
<p class="line">Comely as Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="line">Dazzling as bannered ranks.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the late Russell Martineau, a thorough and
unbiassed scholar, points out in the work phrases from Greek authors of
the third century B. C., and assigns a date not earlier than
247&ndash;222.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1995src" href="#xd21e1995"
name="xd21e1995src">1</a> But may it not be that the Alexandrian of the
third century built on some earlier foundation, as Shakespeare adapted
the &ldquo;Pound of Flesh&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Three Caskets&rdquo;
(Merchant of Venice) from tales traceable as far back as early Buddhist
literature? or as Marlowe and Goethe used the medi&aelig;val legend of
Faustus?</p>
<p>The several songs can hardly be assigned to one and the same
century. The coupling of Tirza and Jerusalem points to a remote past
for that particular lyric, and is it credible that any Jew after
Josiah&rsquo;s time could have written the figleafless songs so
minutely descriptive of Shulamith&rsquo;s physical charms? Could any
Jewish writer of the third century before our era have written iv.
1&ndash;7 or vii. 1&ndash;9, regarding no name or place as too sacred
to be pressed into his hyperboles of rapture at every detail of the
maiden&rsquo;s form, and have done this in perfect innocency, without a
blush? Or if such a poet could have existed in the later Jahvist times,
would his songs have found their place in the Jewish canon? As it was
the book was admitted only with a provision that no Jew under thirty
years of age should read it. That it was included at all was due to the
occult pious meanings read into it by rabbins, while it is tolerably
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>certain that the realistic flesh-painting would
have been expunged but for sanctions of antiquity similar to those
which now protect so many old classics from expurgation by the Vice
Societies. These songs, sensuous without sensuality, with their
Oriental accent, seem ancient enough to have been brought by Solomon
from Ophir.</p>
<p>On the other hand a critical reader can hardly ascribe the whole
book to the Solomonic period. The exquisite exaltation of Love, as a
human passion (viii. 6, 7), brings us into the refined atmosphere amid
which Eros was developed, and it is immediately followed by a song that
hardly rises above doggerel (viii. 8, 9). This is an interruption of
the poem that looks as if suggested by the line that follows it (first
line of verse 10) and meant to be comic. It impresses me as a very late
interpolation, and by a hand inferior to the Alexandrian artist who in
style has so well matched the more ancient pieces in his literary
mosaic. Herder finds the collection as a whole Solomonic, and makes the
striking suggestion that its author at a more mature age would take the
tone of Ecclesiasticus.</p>
<p>Considered simply as a literary production, the composition makes on
my own mind the impression of a romance conveyed in idylls, each
presenting a picturesque situation or a scene, the general theme and
<i>motif</i> being that of the great Solomonic Psalm.</p>
<p>This psalm (xlv.), quoted and discussed in chapter III., brings
before us a beautiful maiden brought from a distant region to the
court, but not quite happy: she is entreated to forget her people and
enjoy the dignities and luxuries offered by her lord, the King. This
psalm is remarkable in its intimations of a freedom of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>sentiment accorded to the ladies wooed by Solomon,
and the same spirit pervades Canticles. Its chief refrain is that love
must not be coerced or awakened until it please. This magnanimity might
naturally connect the name of Solomon with old songs of love and
courtship such as those utilised and multiplied in this book, whose
composition might be naturally entitled &ldquo;A Song (made) of Songs
which are Solomon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heroine, whose name is Shulamith,&mdash;(feminine of Shelomoh,
Solomon)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2017src" href="#xd21e2017" name=
"xd21e2017src">2</a>&mdash;is an only daughter, cherished by her
apparently widowed mother but maltreated by her brothers. Incensed
against her, they compel Shulamith to keep their vineyards to the
neglect of her own. She becomes sunburnt, &ldquo;swarthy,&rdquo; but is
very &ldquo;attractive,&rdquo; and is brought by Solomon to his palace,
where she delights the ladies by her beauty and dances. In what I
suppose to be one of the ancient Solomonic Songs embodied in the work
it is said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;There are threescore queens, and
fourscore concubines,</p>
<p class="line">And maidens without number:</p>
<p class="line">Beyond compare is my dove, my unsoiled;</p>
<p class="line">She is the only one of her mother,</p>
<p class="line">The cherished one of her that bare her:</p>
<p class="line">The daughters saw her and called her blessed,</p>
<p class="line">Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised
her.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2045src" href="#xd21e2045" name=
"xd21e2045src">3</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Thus far the <i>motif</i> seems to be that of a
Cinderella oppressed by brothers but exalted by the most magnificent of
princes. But here the plot changes. The magnificence of Solomon cannot
allure from her shepherd lover this &ldquo;lily of the valley.&rdquo;
Her lover visits her in the palace, where her now relenting brothers
(vi. 12) seem to appear (though this is doubtful) and witness her
triumphs; and all are in raptures at her dancing and her amply
displayed charms&mdash;all unless one (perhaps the lover) who,
according to a doubtful interpretation, complains that they should gaze
at her as at dancers in the camps (vi. 13).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2053src" href="#xd21e2053" name="xd21e2053src">4</a></p>
<p>Although Russell Martineau maintained, against most other
commentators, that Solomon is only a part of the scene, and not among
the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, the King certainly seems to be
occasionally present, as in the following dialogue, where I give the
probable, though of course conjectural, names. The dancer has
approached the King while at table.</p>

<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">Thus we find the damsel anointing the king with her
spikenard, but for her the precious fragrance is her shepherd. Against
the plaits of gold and studs of silver offered in the palace (i. 2) her
lover can only point to his cottage of cedar and fir, and a couch of
grass. She is content to be only a flower of the plain and valley, not
for the seraglio. Nevertheless she remains to dance in the palace; a
sufficient time there is needed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98"
href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>by the poet to illustrate the
impregnability of true love against all other splendors and
attractions, even those of the Flower of Kings. He however puts no
constraint on her, one song, thrice repeated, saying to the ladies of
the harem&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;I adjure you, O daughters of
Jerusalem,</p>

<p class="line">That ye stir not up, nor awaken love,</p>
<p class="line">Until it please.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This refrain is repeated the second time just before a
picture of Solomon&rsquo;s glory, shaded by a suggestion that all is
not brightness even around this Prince of Peace. The ladies of the
seraglio are summoned to look out and see the passing of the King in
state, seated on his palanquin of purple and gold, but escorted by
armed men &ldquo;because of fear in the night.&rdquo; In immediate
contrast with that scene, we see Shulamith going off with her humble
lover, now his bride, to his field and to her vineyard, and singing a
beautiful song of love, strong as death, flame-tipped arrow of a god,
unquenchable, unpurchaseable.</p>
<p>Though according to the revised version of vi. 12 her relatives are
princely, and it may be they who invite her to return (vi. 13), she
says, &ldquo;I am my beloved&rsquo;s.&rdquo; With him she will go into
the field and lodge in the village (vii. 10, 11). She finds her own
little garden and does not envy Solomon.</p>

<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Solomon hath a vineyard at Baalhamon;</p>
<p class="line">He hath let out the vineyard to keepers;</p>
<p class="line">Each for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand
pieces of silver:</p>
<p class="line">My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:</p>
<p class="line">Thou, O Solomon, shall have the thousand,</p>
<p class="line">And those that keep the fruit thereof two
hundred.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was, as we see in Koheleth, a prevailing tradition that
Solomon felt the hollowness of his palatial life. &ldquo;See life with
a woman thou lovest.&rdquo; The wife is the fountain:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Bethink thee of thy fountain</p>
<p class="line">In the days of thy youth.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This perhaps gave rise to a theory that the shepherd
lover was Solomon himself in disguise, like the god Krishna among the
cow-maidens. It does not appear probable that any thought of that kind
was in the writer of this Song. Certainly there appears not to be any
purpose of lowering Solomon personally in enthroning Love above him.
There is no hint of any religious or moral objection to him, and indeed
throughout the work Solomon appears in a favourable light
personally,&mdash;he is beloved by the daughters of Jerusalem (v.
10)&mdash;though his royal estate is, as we have seen, shown in a light
not altogether enviable. Threescore mighty men guard him: &ldquo;every
man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night,&rdquo;
and the day of his heart&rsquo;s gladness was the day of his espousals
(iii. 8, 11).</p>
<p>It is not improbable that there is an allusion to Solomon&rsquo;s
magic seal in the first lines of the hymn to Love (viii. 6). The legend
of the Ring must have been long in growing to the form in which it is
found in the Talmud, where it is said that Solomon&rsquo;s &ldquo;fear
in the night&rdquo; arose from his apprehension that the Devil might
again get hold of his Ring, with which he (Aschmedai) once wrought much
mischief. (<i>Gittin</i>. Vol. 68, col. 1, 2). The hymn strikes me as
late Alexandrian:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Wear me as a seal on thy breast</p>
<p class="line">As a seal-ring on thine arm:</p>
<p class="line">For love is strong as death, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Its passion unappeasable as the grave;</p>
<p class="line">Its shafts are arrows of fire,</p>
<p class="line">The lightnings of a god. [Jah.]</p>
<p class="line">Many waters cannot quench love,</p>
<p class="line">Deluges cannot overwhelm it.</p>
<p class="line">Should a noble offer all the wealth of his house for
love</p>
<p class="line">It would be utterly spurned.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Excluding the interrupting verses 8 and 9, the hymn is
followed by a song about Solomon&rsquo;s vineyard, preceded by two
lines which appear to me to possess a significance overlooked by
commentators. Shulamith (evidently) speaks:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;I was a wall, my breasts like its
towers:</p>
<p class="line">Thus have I been in his eyes as one finding peace.</p>
<p class="line">Solomon hath a vineyard,&rdquo; etc. [as above.]</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The word &ldquo;peace&rdquo; is <i>Shal&ocirc;m</i>;
it is immediately followed by <i>Shelomoh</i> (Solomon,
&ldquo;peaceful&rdquo;); and <i>Shulamith</i> (also meaning
&ldquo;peaceful&rdquo;), thus brings together the fortress of her
lover&rsquo;s peace, her own breast, and the fortifications built by
the peaceful King (who never attacked but was always prepared for
defence). Here surely, at the close of Canticles, is a sort of tableau:
Shal&ocirc;m, Shulamith, Shelomoh: Peace, the prince of Peace, the
queen of Peace. If this were the only lyric one would surely infer that
these were the bride and bridegroom, under the benediction of Peace. It
is not improbable that at this climax of the poem Shulamith means that
in her lover she has found her Solomon, and he found in her his
Solomona,&mdash;their reciprocal strongholds of Shal&ocirc;m or
Peace.</p>
<p>Of course my interpretations of the Song of Songs are largely
conjectural, as all other interpretations necessarily are. The songs
are there to be somehow explained, and it is of importance that every
unbiassed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>student of the book should state his
conjectures, these being based on the contents of the book, and not on
the dogmatic theories which have been projected into it. I have been
compelled, under the necessary limitations of an essay like the
present, to omit interesting details in the work, but have endeavoured
to convey the impression left on my own mind by a totally unprejudiced
study. The conviction has grown upon me with every step that, even at
the lowest date ever assigned it, the work represents the earliest full
expression of romantic love known in any language. It is so entirely
free from fabulous, supernatural, or even pious incidents and accents,
so human and realistic, that its having escaped the modern playwright
can only be attributed to the superstitious encrustations by which its
beauty has been concealed for many centuries.</p>
<p>This process of perversion was begun by Jewish Jahvists, but they
have been far surpassed by our A. S. version, whose solemn nonsense at
most of the chapter heads in the Bible here reached its climax. It is a
remarkable illustration of the depths of fatuity to which clerical
minds may be brought by prepossession, that the closing chapter of
Canticles, with its beautiful exaltation of romantic love, could be
headed: &ldquo;<i>The love of the Church to Christ. The vehemency of
Love. The calling of the Gentiles. The Church Prayeth for
Christ&rsquo;s coming.</i>&rdquo; The &ldquo;Higher Criticism&rdquo; is
now turning the headings into comedy, but they have done&mdash;nay, are
continuing&mdash;their very serious work of misdirection.</p>
<p>It has already been noted that the Jewish doctors exalted Bathsheba,
adulteress as she was, into a blessed woman, probably because of the
allusion to her in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>Song (iii. 2) as having crowned
her royal Son, who had become mystical; and it can only be ascribed to
Protestantism that, instead of the Queen-Mother Mary, the Church
becomes Bathsheba&rsquo;s successor in our version: &ldquo;<i>The
Church glorieth in Christ</i>.&rdquo; And of course the shepherd
lover&rsquo;s feeding (his flock) among the lilies becomes
&ldquo;<i>Christ&rsquo;s care of the Church</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for such fantasies the beautiful Song of Songs might indeed
never have been preserved at all, yet is it a scandal that Bibles
containing chapter-headings known by all educated Christians to be
falsifications, should be circulated in every part of the world, and
chiefly among ignorant and easily misled minds. These simple people,
reading the anathemas pronounced in their Bibles on those who add
anything to the book given them as the &ldquo;Word of God&rdquo;
(Deuteronomy iv. 2, xii. 32, Proverbs xxx. 6, Revelation xxii. 18),
cannot imagine that these chapter-headings are not in the original
books, but forged. And what can be more brazenly fraudulent than the
chapter-heading to one of these very passages (Revelation xxii. 18,
19), where nothing is said of the &ldquo;Word of God,&rdquo; but over
which is printed: &ldquo;18. Nothing may be added to the word of God,
nor taken therefrom.&rdquo; But even the learned cannot quite escape
the effect of these perversions. How far they reach is illustrated in
the fate of Mary Magdalen, a perfectly innocent woman according to the
New Testament, yet by a single chapter-heading in Luke branded for all
time as the &ldquo;sinner&rdquo; who anointed
Jesus,&mdash;&ldquo;Magdalen&rdquo; being now in our dictionaries as a
repentant prostitute. Yet there are hundreds of additions to the Bible
more harmful than this,&mdash;additions which, whether honestly made or
not originally, are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103"
name="pb103">103</a>]</span>now notoriously fraudulent. It is
especially necessary in the interest of the Solomonic and secular
literature in the Bible that Truth shall be liberated from the
malarious well&mdash;Jahvist and ecclesiastical&mdash;in which she has
long been sunk by mistranslation, interpolation, and chapter-headings.
The Christian churches are to be credited with having produced critics
brave enough to expose most of these impositions, and it is now the
manifest duty of all public teachers and literary leaders to uphold
those scholars, to protest against the continuance of the propaganda of
pious frauds, and to insist upon the supremacy of truth. <span class=

Chron. iii. 19 Shelomith is a descendant of Solomon. In these studies
&ldquo;Abishag the Shunamith,&rdquo; 1 Kings i. 2, has been
conjecturally connected with Psalm xlv., and the identity of her name
with Shulamith has also been mentioned. This identity of the names was
suggested by Gesenius and accepted by F&uuml;rst, Renan, and others.
Abishag is thus also a sort of &ldquo;Solomona.&rdquo; In 1 Kings i.
there is some indication of a <i>lacuna</i> between verses 4 and 5.
&ldquo;And the damsel (Abishag) was very fair; and she cherished the
King and ministered to him; but the King knew her not.
Then&rdquo;&mdash;what? why, all about Adonijah&rsquo;s effort to
become king! David did not marry Abishag; she remained a maiden after
his death and free to wed either of the brothers. The care with which
this is certified was probably followed by some story either of her
cleverness or of her relations with Solomon which gave her the name
Shunamith&mdash;Shulamith&mdash;Solomona. Of the Shunamith it is said
they found her far away and &ldquo;brought her to the King,&rdquo; and
in the beginning of the Song Shulamith says &ldquo;The King hath
brought me into his chambers.&rdquo; This suggests a probability of
legends having arisen concerning Abishag, and concerning the lady
entreated in Psalm xlv., which, had they been preserved, might perhaps
account for the coincidence of names, as well as the parallelism of the
situations at court of the lady of the psalm, of Abishag the Shunamith,
and of Shulamith in the &ldquo;song.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">The &ldquo;great woman&rdquo; called Shunamith in 2
Kings 4 was probably so called because of her &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; in
discerning the prophet Elisha, and the reference to the town of Shunem
(verse 8) inserted by a writer who misunderstood the meaning of
Shunamith. This story is unknown to Josephus, though he tells the story
of the widow&rsquo;s pot of oil immediately preceding, in the same
chapter, and asserts that he has gone over the acts of Elisha
&ldquo;particularly,&rdquo; &ldquo;as we have them set down in the
sacred books.&rdquo; (<i>Antiquities.</i> Book ix. ch. 4.) The chapter
(2 Kings iv.) is mainly a mere travesty of the stories told in 1 Kings
xvii., transparently meant to certify that the miraculous power of
Elijah had passed with his mantle to Elisha. There is no mention of
Shunem in the original legend. (1 Kings xvii.)</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

&ldquo;Why will ye look upon Shulamith as upon the dance of

names a place <span class="corr" id="xd21e2055" title=
"Source: Manhanaim">Mahanaim</span>, literally two armies or camps; but
it was in honor of the angels that met him there, and it is possible
that Shulamith is here compared to an angel. If the verse means any
blush at the dancer&rsquo;s display of her person it is the only trace
of prudery in the book, and betrays the Alexandrian.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter X.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Koheleth (Ecclesiastes).</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for February, 1897, a
writer, in giving his personal reminiscences of Tennyson, relates an
anecdote concerning the poet and the Rev. F. D. Maurice. Speaking of
Ecclesiastes (Koheleth), Tennyson said it was the one book the
admission of which into the canon he could not understand, it was so
utterly pessimistic&mdash;of the earth, earthy. Maurice fired up.
&ldquo;Yes, if you leave out the last two verses. But the conclusion of
the whole matter is, &lsquo;Fear God and keep His commandments: for
this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into
judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be
evil.&rsquo; So long as you look only down upon earth, all is
&lsquo;vanity of vanities.&rsquo; But if you look up there is a God,
the judge of good and evil.&rdquo; Tennyson said he would think over
the matter from that point of view.</p>
<p>This amusing incident must have caused a ripple of laughter in
scholastic circles, now that the labors of Cheyne, Renan, Dillon, and
others, have left little doubt that both of the verses cited by Maurice
are later editorial additions. They alone, he admitted, could save the
book, and the charm of the incident is that the verses were placed
there by ancient Maurices to induce ancient Tennysons to &ldquo;think
over the matter from that point of view.&rdquo; The result was that the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>previously rejected book was admitted into the
canon by precisely the same force which continued its work at
Faringford, and continues it to this day. Only one must not suppose
that Mr. Maurice was aware of the ungenuineness of the verses. He was
an honest gentleman, but so ingeniously mystical that had the two
verses not been there he could readily have found others of equally
transcendant and holy significance, without even resorting to other
pious interpolations in the book.</p>
<p>Tennyson was curiously unconscious of his own pessimism. When any
one questioned the belief in a future life in his presence his
vehemence without argument betrayed his sub-conscious misgivings, while
his indignation ran over all the conditional resentments of Job. I have
heard that he said to Tyndall that if he knew there was no future life
he would regard the creator of human beings as a demon, and shake his
fist in His eternal face. This rage was based in a more profoundly
pessimistic view of the present life than anything even in
Ecclesiastes,&mdash;by which name may be happily distinguished the
disordered, perverted, and mistranslated Koheleth.</p>
<p>It appears evident that the sentence which opens Koheleth,&mdash;in
our Bibles &ldquo;All is vanity, saith the Preacher; vanity of
vanities, all is vanity,&rdquo;&mdash;is as mere a Jahvist
chapter-heading as that of our A. S. translators: &ldquo;The Preacher
showeth that all human courses are vain.&rdquo; It is repeated as the
second of the eight verses added at the end of the work. Koheleth does
not label the whole of things vanity; in a majority of cases the things
he calls vain are vain; and some things he finds not
vanity,&mdash;youth, and wedded love, and work that is congenial.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>Renan (<i lang="fr">Histoire du Peuple d&rsquo;Isra&euml;l</i>, Tome
5, p. 158) has shown conclusively, as I think, that the signature on
this book, QHLT, is a mere letter-play on the word
&ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; and the eagerness with which the letters were
turned into Koheleth (which really means Preacheress), and to make
Solomon&rsquo;s inner spouse a preacher of the vanities of pleasure and
the wisdom of fearing God, is thus naively indicated in the successive
names of the book, &ldquo;Koheleth&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Ecclesiastes.&rdquo; We are thus warned by the title to pick our
way carefully where the Jahvist and the Ecclesiastic have been before
us; remembering especially that though piety may induce men to forge
things, this is never done lightly. As people now do not commit forgery
for a shilling, so neither did those who placed spurious sentences or
phrases in nearly every chapter of the Bible do so for anything they
did not consider vital to morality or to salvation. In Ecclesiastes we
must be especially suspicious of the very serious religious points.
Fortunately the style of the book renders it particularly subject to
the critical and literary touchstone.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to point out to any man of literary instinct the
interpolation bracketed in the following verses? &ldquo;Rejoice, O
young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart gladden thee in the flower
of thy age, and walk in the paths of thy heart, and according to the
vision of thine eyes [but know thou that for all these things God will
bring thee into judgment], and banish discontent from thy heart, and
put away evil from thy flesh; for youth and dawn are fleeting. Remember
also thy fountain in the days of thy youth, or ever the evil days come
or the years draw nigh in which thou shalt say I have no delight in
them.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is only by removing the bracketed clause that any consistency can
be found in the lyric, which Professor Cheyne compares with the
following song by the ancient Egyptian harper at the funeral feast of
Neferhotap:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Make a good day, O holy fathers!</p>
<p class="line">Let odors and oils stand before thy nostril;</p>
<p class="line">Wreaths and lotus are on the arms and bosom of thy
sister</p>
<p class="line">Dwelling in thy heart, sitting beside thee.</p>
<p class="line">Let song and music be before thy face,</p>
<p class="line">And leave behind thee all evil dirges!</p>
<p class="line">Mind thee of joy, till cometh the day of
pilgrimage,</p>
<p class="line">When we draw near the land that loveth
silence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2313src" href="#xd21e2313"
name="xd21e2313src">1</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">There is no historical means of determining what
writings of Solomon are preserved in the Bible and even in the
apocryphal books. One may feel that Goethe recognised a brother spirit
in that far epoch when he selected for his proverb:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Apples of gold in chased work of
silver,</p>
<p class="line">A word smoothly spoken.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Koheleth too appreciated this, and also (x. 12) uses
almost literally Proverbs xii. 18, &ldquo;The tongue of the wise is
gentleness.&rdquo; (Compare Shakespeare&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Let
gentleness my strong enforcement be.&rdquo;) The lines previously
cited, &ldquo;Rejoice O young man, etc.,&rdquo; are also probably
quoted, as they are given in poetical quatrains. There are many of
these quatrains introduced into the book, from the prose context of
which they differ in style and sometimes in sense.</p>
<p>In none of these metrical quotations (as I believe them to be) is
there any belief in God, the only instance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>in
which the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; is mentioned being an ironical maxim
about the danger coming from monarchs because of their oaths to their
God, with whom they identify their own ways and wishes. Such seems to
me the meaning of the lines (viii. 2, 4) which Dillon
translates&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;The wise man harkens to the king&rsquo;s
command,</p>
<p class="line">By reason of the oath to God.</p>
<p class="line">Mighty is the word of the monarch:</p>
<p class="line">Who dares ask him, &lsquo;What dost
thou?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">With this compare Proverbs xxi. 1, &ldquo;The
king&rsquo;s heart is in the hand of the Lord (Jahveh) as the
water-courses; he turneth it whithersoever he will.&rdquo; This proverb
is evidently by a Jahvist, and Koheleth quotes another which signifies
rather &ldquo;Jahveh is in the king&rsquo;s caprice.&rdquo; But he
adopts the neighbouring proverb, &ldquo;To do justice and judgment is
more acceptable to Jahveh than sacrifice.&rdquo; Koheleth says, and
this is not quoted&mdash;&ldquo;To draw near to (God) in order to
learn, is better than the offering of sacrifices by fools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the verses quoted by Maurice to Tennyson (xii. 13, 14) are
not genuinely in Koheleth they correspond with sentences in the genuine
text of very different import. Koheleth, though his quotations are
godless, believes there is a God, and a formidable one. Sometimes he
refers to him as Fate, sometimes as the unknowable, but as without
moral quality. &ldquo;To the just men that happeneth which should
befall wrong-doers; and that happeneth for criminals which should be
the lot of the upright&rdquo; (viii. 14), and &ldquo;neither
(God&rsquo;s) love nor hatred doth a man foresee&rdquo; (ix. 1). God
has set prosperity and adversity side by side for the express
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>purpose of hiding Himself from human knowledge
(vii. 14); not, alas, as the Yalkut Koheleth suggests, in order that
one may help the other. God does benefit those who please him, and
punish those who displease him; this is &lsquo;good&rsquo; and
&lsquo;evil&rsquo; to <i>Him</i>; but it has no relation with the
humanly good and evil (viii. 11&ndash;14). As it is evident that
God&rsquo;s favor is not secured by good works nor his disfavor
incurred by evil works, a prudent man will consider that it may perhaps
be a matter of etiquette, and will be punctilious, especially &ldquo;in
the house of God&rdquo;; he will not speak rashly and then hope to
escape by saying &ldquo;it was rashness.&rdquo; His words had better be
few, and if he makes any vow (which may well be avoided) he should
perform it. But as for practical life and conduct, God, or fate, is
clearly indifferent to it, consequently let a man eat his bread and
quaff his wine with joy, love his wife,&mdash;the best portion of his
lot,&mdash;and whatever his hand findeth to do that do with vigor,
remembering that &ldquo;there is no work, nor thought, nor knowledge,
nor wisdom, in the inevitable grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is Koheleth&rsquo;s conception of life, which, except so far as
it is marred by a vague notion of Fate which is fatal to philanthropy,
is not very different from the idea growing in our own time. &ldquo;The
All is a never-ceasing whirl&rdquo; (i. 8), and Koheleth advises that
each individual man try to make what little circle of happiness he can
around him. &ldquo;O my heart!&rdquo; says Omar Khayy&aacute;m,
&ldquo;thou wilt never penetrate the mysteries of the heavens; thou
wilt never reach that culminating point of wisdom which the intrepid
omniscients have attained. Resign thyself then to make what little
paradise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>thou canst here below. As for that close-barred
seraglio beyond thou shalt arrive there&mdash;or thou shalt
not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is, however, impossible for any church or priesthood to be
maintained on any such principles. Where mankind believe with Koheleth
that whatever God does is forever, that nothing can be superadded to it
nor aught be taken away; and that God has so contrived that man must
fear Him; they will have no use for any paraphernalia for softening the
irrevocable decrees of a Judgment Day already past. But
Koheleth&rsquo;s arrows, feathered with wit and eloquence, were
logically shot from the Jahvist arquebus. It was Jahveh himself who
proudly claimed that he created good and evil, and that if there were
evil in a city it was his work. It was Jahveh&rsquo;s own prophet,
Isaiah, who cried (lxiii. 17), &ldquo;O Lord, why dost Thou make us to
err from Thy ways, and hardenest our heart from Thy fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What then could Jahvism say when a time arrived wherein it must
defend itself against a Jahveh-created world? <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was necessary that Koheleth should be answered, but
who was competent for this? A fable had been invented of a Solomonic
serpent who had tempted Eve to taste the fruit of knowledge which, when
the man shared it, brought a curse on the earth, but the canonical
prophets do not appear to have heard of it, and at any rate it was too
late in the day to meet fact with fable. Nor had Jahveh&rsquo;s
whirlwind-answer to Job proved effectual. However, some sort of answer
did come, and significantly enough it had to come from Koheleth&rsquo;s
own quarter, the Wisdom school. Pure Jahvism had not brains enough for
the task.</p>
<p>The apocryphal book &ldquo;Ecclesiasticus&rdquo; is the antidote to
Ecclesiastes. (These are the Christian names given to the two books.)
This book, bearing the simple title &ldquo;Wisdom,&rdquo; compiled and
partly written by Jesus Ben Sira early in the second century B. C., is
as a whole much more than an offset to Koheleth. It is a great though
unintentional literary monument to Solomon, and it is the book of
reconciliation, or so intended, between Solomonism and
Jahvism,&mdash;or, as we should now say, between philosophy and
theology.</p>
<p>The newly discovered original Hebrew of Ecclesiasticus xxxix. 15,
xlix. 11, published by the Clarendon Press in 1897, enables us to read

and prepare his sanctuary for ever.</p>
<p>14. How wast thou wise in thy youth, and didst overflow with
instruction like the Nile!</p>
<p>15. The earth (was covered by thy soul) and thou didst celebrate
song in the height.</p>
<p>16. Thy name went far unto the islands, and for thy peace thou wast
beloved.</p>
<p>17. The countries marvelled at thee for thy songs, and proverbs, and
parables, and interpretations.</p>
<p>18. Thou wast called by the glorious name which is called over
Israel.</p>
<p>18a. Thou didst gather gold as tin, and didst gather silver as
lead.</p>
<p>19. But thou gavest thy loins unto women, and lettest them have
dominion over thy body.</p>
<p>20. Thou didst stain thy honour and pollute thy seed; so that thou
broughtest wrath upon thy children, that they should groan in their
beds.</p>
<p>21. That the kingdom should be divided: and out of Ephraim ruled a
rebel kingdom.</p>
<p>22. But the Lord will never leave off his mercy, neither shall any
of his words perish, neither will he abolish the posterity of his
elect, and the seed of him that loveth him he will not take away:
wherefore he gave a remnant unto Jacob, and out of him a root unto
David.</p>
<p>23. Thus rested Solomon with his fathers, and of his seed he left
behind him Rehoboam [of the lineage of Ammon], ample in foolishness and
lacking understanding, who by his council let loose the people.</p>
</div>
<p>In the last sentence I have inserted in crochets an alternative
reading of Fritzsche for the three words <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>that follow.
(Rehoboam&rsquo;s Ammonite mother was Naamah.)</p>
<p>It will be noticed that early in the second century B. C. there
remained no trace of the anathemas on Solomon for his foreign or his
idolatrous wives. He is now simply accused of being too fond of
women,&mdash;a charge not known to the canonical books.</p>
<p>The verse 18 attests the correctness of the view taken of the
forty-fifth Psalm in chapter III., written before this Clarendon Press
volume appeared. It thus becomes certain that the Psalm was recognised
as written in Solomon&rsquo;s time, and that it was he who was there
addressed as &ldquo;God&rdquo; (&ldquo;the glorious name&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The mention of this fact in &ldquo;Wisdom,&rdquo; and the enthusiasm
pervading every sentence of the tribute to Solomon, despite his alleged
sensuality, supply conclusive evidence that the cult of Solomon had for
more than eight centuries been continuous, that it was at length
prevailing, and that it had become necessary for a broad wing of
Jahvism to include the Solomonic worldly wisdom and ethics.</p>
<p>Jesus Ben Sira states that he found a book written by his learned
grandfather, whose name was also Jesus, who had studied many works of
&ldquo;our fathers,&rdquo; and added to them writings of his own. The
anonymous preface states that Sira, son of the first Jesus, left it to
his son, and that &ldquo;this Jesus did imitate Solomon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not said that Sira contributed anything to this composite
work, yet there appear to be three minds in it. There is a fine and
free philosophy which savors of the earliest traditions of the
Solomonic School; there is an exceptionally morose Jahvism; and there
is also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>mysticism, an attempt to rationalise and soften
the Jahvism, and to solemnise the philosophy, so as to blend them in a
kind of harmonious religion. I cannot help feeling that Sira or some
friend of his must have inserted the Jahvism between the grandfather
and the grandson.</p>
<p>However this may be, it is evident that Jesus Ben Sira was too
reverent to seriously alter anything in the volume before him, for the
contrast is startling between the hard Jahvism and the philosophy of
life. Their inclusion in one work is like the union of oil and vinegar.
The Jahvism is curiously bald: fear Jahveh, keep his commandments, pay
your tithes, say your prayers, be severe with your children (especially
daughters), never play with them, guard your wife vigilantly, flog your
servants. The philosophy is quite incongruous with this formalism and
rigidity, most of the maxims being elaborated with care, and only
proverbs in form. Some of them are almost Shakespearian in artistic
expression:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Pipe and harp make sweet the song, but a
sincere tongue is above them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisdom hid, and treasure hoarded, what value is in
either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fool&rsquo;s heart is in his mouth, the wise man&rsquo;s
mouth is in his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above that
of the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoso regardeth dreams is as one who grasps at his
shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil man cursing Satan is but cursing himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bars of Wisdom shall be thy fortress, her chains thy robe
of honour.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>About the rendering of xli. 15 there is some doubt, and I give this
conjecture: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Better the (ignorant) that hideth his folly, than the
(learned) who hideth his wisdom.</p>
</div>
<p>In the Bible which belonged to the historian Gibbon, loaned by the
late General Meredith Read to the Gibbon exhibition in London, I
observed a pencil mark around these sentences in
&ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;He that buildeth his house with other
men&rsquo;s money, is like one that gathereth stones for the tomb of
his own burial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that is not wise will not be taught, but there is a wisdom
that multiplieth bitterness.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>To Jesus Ben Sira we may, I believe, ascribe the following:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Glorifying God, exalt him as far as your
thought can reach, yet you will never attain to his height: praising
him, put forth all your powers, be not weary, yet ever will they fall
short. Who hath seen him that he can tell us? Who can describe him as
he is? Let us still be rejoicing in him, for we shall not search him
out: he is great beyond his works.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This has an interesting correspondence with the beautiful rapture of
the Persian S&acirc;di:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;They who pretend to be informed are ignorant,
for they who have known him have not recovered their senses. O thou who
towerest above the heights of imagination, thought, or conjecture,
surpassing all that has been related, and excelling all that we have
heard or read, the banquet is ended, the congregation is dismissed, and
life draws to a close, and we still rest in our first encomium of
thee!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>To Jesus Ben Sira may be safely ascribed the passages that bear
witness to the pressure of problems which, though old, appear in new
forms under Hellenic influences. They grow urgent and threaten the
foundations of Jahvism. It was no longer sufficient to say that Jahveh
rewarded virtue and piety, and punished vice and impiety in this world.
Job had demanded the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span>evidence for this, and the centuries had
brought none. Job was awarded some recompense in this world, but that
happy experience did not attend other virtuous sufferers.</p>
<p>The doctrine of one writer in &ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; is simply
predestination. Paul&rsquo;s potter-and-clay similitude is anticipated,
and the Parsi dualism curiously adapted to Jahvist monotheism:
&ldquo;Good is set against evil, life against death, the godly against
the sinner and the sinner against the godly: look through all the works
of the Most High and there are two and two, one against another.&rdquo;
But the liberal son of Sira is more optimist: &ldquo;All things are
double, one against another, but he hath made nothing imperfect: one
thing establisheth the good of another.&rdquo; Freedom of the will is
asserted: &ldquo;Say not, he hath caused me to err, for he hath no need
of the evildoer. He made man from the beginning and left him in the
hand of his (own) counsel.... He hath set fire and water before thee,
stretch forth thy hand to whichever thou wilt. Before man is the living
and the not-living, and whichever he liketh shall be given
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the doctrine of human free agency is pregnant with polemics; it
has so been in Christian history, as is proved by the Pelagian,
Arminian, Jesuit, and Wesleyan movements. There are indications in Ben
Sira&rsquo;s work that the foundations of Jahvism were threatened by a
moral scepticism. His own celebration of the Fathers was enough to
bring into dreary contrast the tragedies of his own time and glories of
the Past, when &ldquo;Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under
his vine and fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of
Solomon.&rdquo; What shelter now in the divine <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>fig-tree, which could bear nothing but legendary
or predictive leaves? The curse on the barren tree was near at hand
when Jesus Ben Sira uttered his pathetic complaint, veiled in
prayer:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Have mercy on us, O Lord God of all, and regard
us! Send thy fear on all the nations that seek thee not; lift thy hand
against them, let them see thy power! As thou wast (of old) sanctified
in us before them, be thou (now) magnified among them before us; and
let them know thee, as we have known thee,&mdash;that there is, O God,
no God but thou alone! Show new signs, more strange wonders; glorify
thy hand and thy right arm, that they may publish thy wondrous works!
Raise up indignation, pour out wrath, remove the adversary, destroy the
enemy: hasten! remember thy covenant, and let them witness thy
wonderful works!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter XII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Wisdom of Solomon.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Somewhat more than a century after Jesus Ben
Sira&rsquo;s work, came an answer to his prayer, not from above but
from beneath, in the so-called &ldquo;Psalter of Solomon.&rdquo; This
is no wisdom book, and need not detain us. It is mainly a
hash&mdash;one may say a mess&mdash;made up out of the Psalms; and
though some of the allusions, apparently to Pompey and others, may
possess value in other connexions, the work need only be mentioned here
as an indication of the fate which Solomon met at the hands of Jahvism.
The name of the Wisest of his race on this vulgar production is like
the doggerel on Shakespeare&rsquo;s tomb, and the fling at
England&rsquo;s greatest poet written on the tomb of his
daughter,&mdash;&ldquo;Wise to salvation was good Mistriss Hall,&rdquo;
etc.</p>
<p>Before passing, it may be remarked that the obvious allusions to
Christ in this Psalter seem clearly spurious, and for one I cannot
regard as other than a late interpolation verse 24 of Psalter-Psalm
xvii.: &ldquo;Behold, O God, and raise up unto them their king, the Son
of David, in the time which thou, O God, knowest, that he may reign
over Israel thy servant.&rdquo; There is nothing in the literature of
the time before or after that would warrant the concession to this
ranting Salvationist (B. C. 70&ndash;60) of an idea which would then
have been original. The verse has the accent of a Second Adventist
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>a century later. The title &ldquo;Son of
David&rdquo; occurs even in the New Testament but sixteen times.</p>
<p>The Psalter is in spirit thoroughly Jahvist, narrow, hard, without
one ray of Solomonic wisdom or wit. It may fairly be regarded as the
sepulchre of the wise man whose name it bears (though not in its text).
Jahvism has here triumphed over the whole cult of Wisdom.</p>
<p>But Solomon is not to rest there. He is again evoked, though not yet
in his ancient secular greatness, by the next work that claims our
attention.</p>
<p>This last of the Wisdom Books bears the heading &ldquo;Wisdom of
Solomon&rdquo; (<i>Sophia Solomontos</i>) and gives unmistakable
identifications of the King, though herein also the name
&ldquo;Solomon&rdquo; appears only in the title. Perhaps the writer may
have wished to avoid exciting the ridicule or resentment of the
Solomonists by plainly connecting the name of their founder with a
retractation of all the secularism and the heresies anciently
associated with him. The aristocratic Sadducees, who believed not in
immortality, derived their name from Solomon&rsquo;s famous chaplain,
Zadok.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; probably appeared not far from
the first year of our era. It is written in almost classical Greek, is
full of striking and poetic interpretations and spiritualisations of
Jewish legends, and transfused with a piety at once warm and mystical.
Solomon is summoned much in the way that the &ldquo;Wandering
Jew,&rdquo; Ahasuerus, is called up in Shelley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Prometheus,&rdquo; yet not quite allegorically, to testify
concerning the Past, and concerning the mysteries of the invisible
world. He has left behind his secularist Proverbs and his worldly
wisdom; but though he now rises as a prophet of otherworldliness, not a
word is uttered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120"
name="pb120">120</a>]</span>inconsistent with his having been a saint
from the beginning, albeit &ldquo;chastised&rdquo; and
&ldquo;proved.&rdquo; In fact he gives his spiritual autobiography,
which is that of a Son of God wise and &ldquo;undefiled&rdquo; from
childhood. His burden is to warn the kings and judges of the world of
the blessedness that awaits the righteous,&mdash;the misery that awaits
the unrighteous,&mdash;beyond the grave.</p>
<p>The work impresses me as having been written by one who had long
been an enthusiastic Solomonist, but who had been spiritually
revolutionised by attaining the new belief of immortality. It does not
appear as if the apparition of Solomon was to this writer a simple
imagination. Solomon seems to be alive, or rather as if never dead.
&ldquo;For thou (God) hast power of life and death: thou leadest to the
gates of Hades, and bringest up again.&rdquo; &ldquo;The giving heed
unto her (Wisdom&rsquo;s) laws is the assurance of incorruption; and
incorruption maketh us near unto God: therefore the desire of Wisdom
bringeth to a Kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jewish people idealised Solomon&rsquo;s reign long before they
idealised the man himself; and indeed he had to reach his halo under
personified epithets derived from his fame,&mdash;as
&ldquo;Melchizedek,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prince of Peace.&rdquo; The
nation sighed for the restoration of his splendid empire, but could not
describe their Coming Man as a returning Solomon, because the priests
and prophets,&mdash;a gentry little respected by the Wise
Man,&mdash;steadily ascribed all the national misfortunes to the
shrines built to other deities than Jahveh by the royal Citizen of the
World. Thus grew such prophetic indirections as &ldquo;the House of
David,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesse&rsquo;s branch,&rdquo; and finally
&ldquo;Son of David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this idea of the returning hero does not appear <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>to
have been original with any Semitic people; it is first found among
them in the Oriental book of Job, who longs to sleep in some cavern for
ages, then reappear, and, even if his flesh were shrivelled, find that
his good name was vindicated (xiv.). This idea of the Sleeping Hero
(which is traced in many examples in my work on <i>The Wandering
Jew</i>) appears to have gained its earliest expression in the legend
of King Yima, in Persia,&mdash;the original of such sleepers as
Barbarossa and King Arthur, as well as of the legendary Enoch, Moses,
and Elias, who were to precede or attend the revived Son of David.
Solomon, whose name probably gave Jerusalem the peaceful half of its
name (<i>Salem</i>) would no doubt have been central among the
&ldquo;Undying Ones&rdquo; had it not been for the Parliament of
Religions he set up in that city. But he had to wait a thousand years
for his honorable fame to awaken.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; the Queen of Sheba is also
recalled into life. She is, as Renan pointed out, transfigured in the
personified Wisdom, and her gifts become mystical. &ldquo;All good
things together came to me with her,&rdquo; and <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2522" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Wisdom goeth before
them: and I knew not that she was the mother of them.&rdquo; She is
amiable, beautiful, and gave him his knowledge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All such things as are secret or manifest, them I knew. For
Wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: for in her is an
understanding spirit, holy, one only, manifold; subtle, lively, clear,
undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good,
quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good, kind to man,
steadfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all
things, and pervading all intellectual, pure, and most subtle spirits.
For Wisdom is more moving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>than motion itself; she passeth
and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness. For she is the
breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory
of the Almighty: therefore can no impure thing fall into her. For she
is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the
power of God, and the image of his goodness. And alone, she can do all
things; herself unchanged, she maketh all things new; and in all ages,
entering into holy souls, she maketh them intimates of God, and
prophets. For God loveth only him who dwelleth with Wisdom. She is more
beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars; compared with
the light she is found before it,&mdash;for after light cometh night,
but evil shall not prevail against Wisdom.&rdquo; (vii.
21&ndash;30.)</p>
<p>In <i>Sophia Solomontos</i> Solomon relates his espousal of Wisdom,
who sat beside the throne of God (ix. 4). But there remains with God a
detective Wisdom called the Holy Spirit. Wisdom and the Holy Spirit
have different functions. &ldquo;Thy counsel who hath known except thou
give Wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above?&rdquo; This verse
(ix. 17) is followed by two chapters (x., xi.) relating the work of
Wisdom through past ages as a Saviour. But then comes an account of the
severe chastening functions of the Holy Spirit. &ldquo;For thine
incorruptible Spirit is in all things (i. e., nothing is concealed from
her), therefore chastenest thou them by little and little that
offend,&rdquo; etc. (xii. 1, 2.)</p>
<p>There is here a slight variation in the historic development of the
Spirit of God, and one so pregnant with results that it may be well to
refer to some of the earlier <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href=
"#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>Hebrew conceptions. The Spirit of
God described in Genesis i. 2, as &ldquo;brooding&rdquo; over the
waters was evidently meant to represent a detached agent of the deity.
The legend is obviously related to that of the dove going forth over
the waters of the deluge. The dove probably acquired its symbolical
character as a messenger between earth and heaven from the marvellous
powers of the carrier pigeon&mdash;powers well known in ancient
Egypt&mdash;it also appears that its cooing was believed to be an echo
on earth of the voice of God.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2538src" href=
"#xd21e2538" name="xd21e2538src">1</a> We have already seen (viii.)
that Wisdom, when first personified, was identified with this
&ldquo;brooding&rdquo; spirit over the surface of the waters, and also
that in a second (Jahvist) personification she is a severe and
reproving agent. But in the second verse of Genesis there is a darkness
on the abyss, and both darkness and abyss were personified. In the
rigid development of monotheism all of these beings were necessarily
regarded as agents of Jahveh&mdash;monopolist of all powers. We thus
find such accounts as that in 1 Samuel 16, where the Spirit of Jahveh
departed from Saul and an evil Spirit from Jahveh troubled him.</p>
<p>Although the Spirit of God was generally supposed to convey
miraculous knowledge, especially of future events, and superior skill,
it is not, I believe, in any book earlier than <i>Sophia Solomontos</i>
definitely ascribed the function of a detective. There is in
Ecclesiastes (x. 20) a passage which suggests the carrier: &ldquo;Curse
not the King, no, not in thy thought; and curse not the rich even in
thy bedchamber; for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that
which hath wings shall tell the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124"
href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>matter.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2548src" href="#xd21e2548" name="xd21e2548src">2</a>
This was evidently in the mind of the writer of <i>Sophia
Solomontos</i> in the following verses:</p>
<p>Wisdom is a loving Spirit, and will not (cannot?) acquit a
blasphemer of his words: for God is a witness of his reins, and a true
beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue; for the Spirit of
the Lord filleth the world, and that which containeth all things hath
knowledge of the voice; therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things
cannot be hid, neither shall vengeance when it punisheth, pass by him.
For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly; the
sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the disclosure of his
wickedness, the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the sound even
of murmurings is not secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we have the origin of the &ldquo;unpardonable sin.&rdquo; The
Holy Spirit detects and informs, Jahveh avenges, and if the offence is
blasphemy, Wisdom, the Saviour, cannot acquit (as the &ldquo;Loving
Spirit&rdquo; of God it is for her <i>ultra vires</i>). This detective
Holy Spirit appears to be an evolution from both Wisdom and Satan the
Accuser, in Job a Son of God. By associating with Solomon on earth,
Wisdom was without the severe holiness essential to Jahvist conceptions
of divine government; in other words, personified Wisdom, whose
&ldquo;delight was with the sons of men&rdquo; (Prov. viii. 31) was too
humanized to fulfil the conditions necessary for upholding the temple
at a time when penal sanctions were withdrawn from the priesthood. A
celestial spy was needed, and also an uncomfortable <i>Sheol</i>, if
the ancient ordinances and sacrifices were to be preserved <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>at
all under the rule of Roman liberty, and amid the cosmopolitan
conditions prevailing at Jerusalem, and still more at
Alexandria.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2572src" href="#xd21e2572" name=
"xd21e2572src">3</a></p>
<p>With regard to Wisdom herself, there is a sentence which requires
notice, especially as no unweighed word is written in the work under
notice. It is said, &ldquo;In that she is conversant with God, she
magnifieth her nobility; yea, the Lord of all things himself loved
her.&rdquo; (viii. 3).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2580src" href=
"#xd21e2580" name="xd21e2580src">4</a> This seems to be the germ of
Philo&rsquo;s idea of Wisdom as the Mother: &ldquo;And she, receiving
the seed of God, with beautiful birth-pangs brought forth this world,
His visible Son, only and well-beloved.&rdquo; The writer of <i>Sophia
Solomontos</i> is very careful to be vague in speculations of this
kind, while suggesting inferences with regard to them. Thus, alluding
to Moses before Pharaoh, he says, &ldquo;She (Wisdom) entered into the
servant of the Lord, and withstood dreadful kings in wonders and
signs&rdquo; (x. 16), but leaves us to mere conjecture as to whether he
(the writer) still had Wisdom in mind when writing (xvii. 13) of the
failure of these enchantments and the descent of the Almighty Word, for
the destruction of the first-born:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For while all things are quiet silence, and that night was in
the midst of her swift course, thine Almighty Word leaped down from
Heaven out of thy Royal throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst
of a land <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>of destruction; and brought thine unfeigned
commandment as a sharp sword, and standing up filled all things with
death; and it touched the heaven, but it stood upon the
earth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2596src" href="#xd21e2596"
name="xd21e2596src">5</a></p>
<p>The Word in this place (<span class="trans" title=
"ho pantodynamos sou logos"><span class="Greek" lang="el">&#8001;
&pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&delta;&#8059;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&#8057;&sigmaf;
&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;
&lambda;&#8057;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>) is clearly
reproduced in the Epistle to the Hebrews (iv. 12). &ldquo;The Word of
God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword;&rdquo;
and the same military metaphor accompanies this &ldquo;Word&rdquo; into
Revelation xix. 13. This continuity of metaphor has apparently been
overlooked by Alford (<i>Greek Testament</i>, vol. iv., p. 226) who
regards the use of the phrase &ldquo;Word of God&rdquo; (<span class=
"trans" title="ho logos tou theou"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#8001; &lambda;&#8057;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166; &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#8166;</span></span>)
as linking Revelation to the author of the fourth Gospel, whereas in
this Gospel Logos is never followed by &ldquo;of God,&rdquo; while it
is so followed in Hebrews iv. 12.</p>
<p>This evolution of the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; is clear. In the
&ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; Wisdom is the creative Word and the
Saviour. The Word leaping down from the divine throne and bearing the
sword of vengeance is more like the son of the celestial counterpart of
Wisdom, namely, the detective Holy Spirit (called in i. 5 &ldquo;the
Holy Spirit of Discipline&rdquo;). But in the era we are studying, all
words by able writers were living things, and were two-edged swords,
and long after they who wrote them were dead went on with active and
sundering work undreamed of by those who first uttered them.</p>
<p>The Zoroastrian elements which we remarked in Jesus Ben Sira&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; are even more pronounced in the &ldquo;Wisdom of
Solomon.&rdquo; The Persian worshippers are so mildly rebuked (xiii.)
for not passing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127"
name="pb127">127</a>]</span>beyond fire and star to the &ldquo;origin
of beauty,&rdquo; that one may suppose the author, probably an
Alexandrian, must have had friends among them. At any rate his
conception of a resplendent God is Mazdean, his all-seeing Holy Spirit
is the Pars&icirc; &ldquo;Anahita,&rdquo; and his Wisdom is
Arma&icirc;ti, the &ldquo;loving spirit&rdquo; on earth, the saviour of
men.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2627src" href="#xd21e2627" name=
"xd21e2627src">6</a> The opposing kingdoms of Ahuramazda and
Angromainyu, and especially Zoroaster&rsquo;s original division of the
universe into &ldquo;the living and the not-living,&rdquo; are
reflected in the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon,&rdquo; i. 13&ndash;16:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the
destruction of the living. He created all things that they might have
their being; and the generations of the world were healthful; and there
(was) no poison of destruction in them, nor (any) kingdom of death on
the earth: (for righteousness is immortal): but ungodly men with their
deeds and words evoked Death to them: when they thought to have it
their friend they consumed to naught, and made a covenant with Death,
being fit to take sides with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the moral and religious evolution which we have been tracing it
has been seen that the utter indifference of the Cosmos to human good
and evil, right and wrong, was the theme of Job; that in Ecclesiastes
the same was again declared, and the suggestion made that if God helped
or afflicted men it must depend on some point of etiquette or
observance unconnected with moral considerations, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>so
that man need not omit pleasure but only be punctilious when in the
temple; that in Jesus Ben Sira&rsquo;s contribution to his
fathers&rsquo; &ldquo;Wisdom,&rdquo; the moral character of God was
maintained, moral evil regarded as hostile to God, and imaginary
sanctions invented, accompanied by pleadings with God to indorse them
by new signs and wonders. Such signs not appearing, and no rewards and
punishments being manifested in human life, the next step was to assign
them to a future existence, and this step was taken in &ldquo;Wisdom of
Solomon.&rdquo; There remained but one more necessity, namely, that
there should be some actual evidence of that future existence.
Agur&rsquo;s question had remained unanswered&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="main">Epistle to the Hebrews (A Sequel to Sophia

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a Theocracy the birth of a new God was not the mere
new generalization that it might be in our secularized century,&mdash;a
deification of the Unknowable, for instance,&mdash;of not the slightest
practical or moral interest to any human being. Judea was the bodily
incarnation, even more than Islam is now, of a deity who said, &ldquo;I
am the Lord and there is none else; I form the light and create
darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I the Lord do all these
things.&rdquo; The denial of such a deity, the substitution of one who
required neither prayers, sacrifices, nor intercessions, could not be
merely theoretical. It must involve the overthrow of a nationality
which had no bond of unity except a book, and the institutions founded
on that book.</p>
<p>Nor did the theocratic principle admit of a mere philosophical
opposition to its institutions. He who touched that system was dealing
with people who, in the language of &ldquo;Sophia Solomontos&rdquo;
were &ldquo;shut up in a prison without iron bars.&rdquo; The natural
advent of the anti-Jahvist was in the Temple and with the
words&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He hath sent me to herald glad news to the poor,</p>
<p class="line">He hath sent me to proclaim deliverance to
captives,</p>
<p class="line">And recovering of sight to the blind,</p>
<p class="line">To set at liberty them that are bruised.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=

<p>These miseries had no real relation to the social or political
conditions amid which their phrases and hymns were born, but to a
burden of debts to a jealous and vindictive omnipotence; a burden not
of actions really wrong, but of mysterious offences, related to
incomprehensible ordinances and heavenly etiquette. No human vices are
so malignant as inhuman virtues.</p>
<p>Bunyan, in depicting Christian&rsquo;s burden, has, with a felicity
perhaps unconscious, made it a pack strapped on. It is not a hunch, not
any part of the pilgrim, and had he possessed the courage to examine it
there must have been found many spiritual nightmares of the race, and
many robust English virtues turned to sins when the merry and honest
tinker turned retrospective Rip Van Winkle, and dreamed himself back
into the year One. The burden of sins on the poor Israelites had been
gradually getting lighter under the scepticism of the Wisdom school, in
view of the failure of Jahveh to fulfil the menaces and sentences of
the priesthood. Conformity was secured mainly for actual advantages
bestowed by the synagogue, or its terrors. But the discovery of the
doctrine of a future life and a day of judgment, when all the
mysterious &ldquo;sins&rdquo; were to be settled for, while smiled at
by the Saducees, made the burden of the ignorant poor intolerable. Life
was passed under suspended swords. The priesthood had a cowering vassal
in every ignorant human being. The time, the labour, the flocks of the
peasantry were devoted, but it was all a &ldquo;sweating&rdquo;
process,&mdash;the debts were never paid, and there was always that
&ldquo;certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of
fire which shall devour the adversaries.&rdquo; No doubt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>even
the learned supposed these superstitions useful to keep the
&ldquo;masses&rdquo; in order.</p>
<p>But one day a scholarly gentleman, a man of genius, was moved with
compassion for these poor lost and priest-harried sheep: he turned
aside from his college and his rank, and became their shepherd; he
declared they owed no duties to any deity, and that the heavenly despot
they so dreaded had no existence.</p>
<p>A modern gentleman in a fine mansion and estate may be amused at
Bunyan&rsquo;s quaint pilgrim, reading in a book and discovering that
he was in a City of Destruction, fleeing with a burden on his back, and
rejoicing when it rolls off at the cross. But if this gentleman should
suddenly receive from some distant personage papers showing that his
estate had been entirely mortgaged by his father, that it would soon be
claimed and his family reduced to beggary, he might understand the City
of Destruction. And if, soon after, some visitor arrived to state that
the holder of the mortgages was dead; that those claims had all legally
fallen into his own hands, and that he had burnt them, the rolling off
of Christian&rsquo;s burden might be appreciated,&mdash;also the
enthusiasm of the personal followers of Jesus.</p>
<p>But one might further imagine a host of hungry lawyers, living on
large retainers, not being quite happy at such easy settlements,
especially if the generous visitor were found wealthy enough to go
about buying up and burning claims, and ending litigation. This, to us
hardly imaginable, was, however, actually the condition of things
reflected in parts of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Therein the bond
under which man suffers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href=
"#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>is clearly to him who hath the
Power of Death, the <span class="sc">Devil</span>: Jesus ransomed man
from the Devil.</p>
<p>The anonymous tractate superscribed solely &ldquo;To the
Hebrews,&rdquo; though the last admitted into the New Testament, is
probably the earliest document it contains. It has no doubt been
tampered with, but the evidences of the early date of its conception of
Christ remain. Not only was it evidently written before the destruction
of the temple (<i>anno</i> 70), but before there was any thought of a
mission to the Gentiles, who, with Paul their apostle, are ignored.
Some of its phrases and illustrations are found in epistles of Paul,
but, as Dr. Davidson pointed out in his <i>Introduction to the New
Testament</i>, the general doctrine of this treatise is far from
Pauline, and it is difficult to find any reason for supposing that the
few borrowings were not by Paul, other than a preference for Paul, and
disinclination to admit that there is any anonymous work in the New
Testament. The treatise is without Paul&rsquo;s egotism, or his
fatalism, and its conception of the new movement seems decidedly more
primitive than that in the recognised Pauline epistles. The sagacious
Eusebius, &ldquo;father of church history,&rdquo; connects the Epistle
&ldquo;To the Hebrews&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon,&rdquo;
and it seems clear that we have here the bridge between the last
abutment of philosophic or &ldquo;broad&rdquo; Jahvism, and its
&ldquo;new departure&rdquo; as Christism.</p>
<p>It is not of especial importance to the present inquiry to determine
that Paul might not at some youthful period have written this work,
though I cannot see how any critical reader can so imagine; but it will
bear indirectly on that point if we read successively the following
corresponding passages: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>Wisdom of Solomon.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;For Wisdom,
which is the worker of all things, taught me ... she is the breath of
the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the
Almighty; therefore can no unclean thing fall into her. For she is the
brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power
of God, and the image of his goodness. And alone she can do all things;
herself unchanged, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering
into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God and
prophets.&rdquo;&mdash;(vii. 25&ndash;27.) &ldquo;And Wisdom was with
thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the
world.&rdquo; (ix. 9.)</p>
<p><i>Epistle to the Hebrews.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;God, having in time past
spoken to the fathers by many fragments and divers ways in the
prophets, at the end of these days spake unto us in Son whom he
constituted heir of all things, by whom also he fashioned the ages;
who, being the brightness of his light and the image of his substance,
and guiding all things by the word of his authority, having made
purification of sins, sat on the right of majesty in high
places.&rdquo; (i. 1&ndash;3.)</p>
<p><i>Epistle to the Colossians.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Who (the Father)
delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the
kingdom of his son of love, in whom we have our redemption, the
forgiveness of our sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the
first-born of all creation; for in him were all things created, in the
heavens and above the earth, things visible and things invisible,
whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things
have been created through him and unto him; and he is before all
things, and in him all things hold together.&rdquo; (i.
13&ndash;17.)</p>
<p><i>Fourth Gospel.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the
beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him
was not anything made. That which hath been made was life in him, and
the life was the light of men. And the Word became flesh and dwelt
among us, and we beheld his glory&mdash;glory as of an only begotten of
a Father full of grace and truth.&rdquo; (i. 1&ndash;15.)</p>
</div>
<p>It appears to me that the evolution is represented in the order
given. Paul&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;first-born of all creation,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>is an amplification of the word
&ldquo;first-born&rdquo; used in the Epistle to the Hebrews, but there
used in another connection,&mdash;and not solely, as we shall see,
relating to Christ. Paul&rsquo;s phrase corresponds with &ldquo;the
only-begotten,&rdquo; etc., of John, and with the &ldquo;son
constituted heir&rdquo; of the Epistle to the Hebrews, though the
latter is a different Christological conception. When this
writer&rsquo;s doctrinal statement is finished, and after his argument
is begun, he says (i. 6), &ldquo;But when of old bringing the
first-born into the inhabited earth, he saith, And pay homage to him
all angels of God.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;first-born&rdquo; here is
probably the seed from which Paul develops his full flower of doctrine,
given above. Paul&rsquo;s conception of a creative Christ seems later
than the &ldquo;guiding&rdquo; Christ (Heb. i. 3), which recalls the
function of Wisdom as &ldquo;director&rdquo; at the creation (Prov.
viii. 30); and the idea in this epistle to the Hebrews of a previous
and historical Christophany, while harmonious with that of the
&ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; (vii. 27),&mdash;that she (Wisdom)
&ldquo;in all ages enters into holy souls,&rdquo;&mdash;is so
primitive, unique, and so foreign to Paul, that the writer may have
been one of those accused by him of preaching &ldquo;another
Jesus&rdquo; (2 Cor. ii. 4).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2723src" href=
"#xd21e2723" name="xd21e2723src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>Although this Epistle contains the principle ascribed to Jesus,
&ldquo;charity and not sacrifice&rdquo; (xiii. 9) and substitutes for
beasts the &ldquo;sacrifice of praise, the fruit of lips harmonious
with his good name&rdquo; (verse 15), the letter that killeth brought
forth from the same chapter the fatal doctrine that the body of Jesus
was a sacrifice to be eaten. And although this emphasizes the
completeness of his humanity to an extent inconsistent with his deity,
it is on the letter of this Epistle that the deification of Christ is
founded.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">V. 7&ndash;9. &ldquo;Who in the days of his flesh,
having offered up entreaties with vehement crying and tears to him able
to save him out of death, and <i>although</i> inclined to because of
his piety, yet, albeit a son, learned obedience by the things he
suffered; and having been made perfect, became unto all that follow him
the author of eternal salvation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2735src" href="#xd21e2735" name="xd21e2735src">2</a></p>
</div>
<p>He is represented as &ldquo;made perfect through sufferings,&rdquo;
as &ldquo;tempted in all points like (?others) without sin,&rdquo; and
as having without assistance of temple or sacrifices, &ldquo;obtained
eternal redemption&rdquo; (ix. 12). Thus he also needed redemption.</p>
<p>The new covenant of which Jesus was the founder is described in the
words of Jeremiah (xxxi.): <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href=
"#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I will put my laws into their mind,</p>
<p class="line">And on their heart will I write them</p>
<p class="line">And I will be to them a God,</p>
<p class="line">And they shall be to me a people:</p>
<p class="line">And they shall not teach every man his
fellow-citizen,</p>
<p class="line">And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord:</p>
<p class="line">For all shall know me,</p>
<p class="line">From the least unto the greatest.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In quoting this the writer to the Hebrews adds:
&ldquo;In that he saith, &lsquo;A new (covenant) he hath made the first
old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is near unto
vanishing entirely.&rsquo;&rdquo; Here is a primitive Quakerism, but
more conservative; not like George Fox at once sweeping away priesthood
sacraments and ecclesiastical laws before the Inner Light, but pointing
to their near vanishing.</p>
<p>The writer of this Epistle is a philosophical conservative; he
shudders at the idea of a swift and complete overthrow of the
traditional system, and even borrows its old thunders against levitical
sin to menace offences against the new moral God. &ldquo;Our God [also]
is a consuming fire.&rdquo; It is evident by his very warnings that a
great anti-sacerdotal and anti-levitical revolution had taken place,
and that the free spirit was burgeoning out in excesses. But such is
his culture that one may suspect his thunders of being theatrical, and
that he thinks some superstition necessary for the masses.</p>
<p>The fatal and subtle character of the detective Holy Spirit is
imported into this Epistle from the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; (i.
6), though not so distinctly personified. The sin afterwards called
&ldquo;unpardonable&rdquo; is here a sin against Christ for which
repentance, not pardon, is impossible. We may perhaps find in some of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>expressions germs of the legend of Judas.
&ldquo;As touching those who were once enlightened, and tasted the
heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and tasted
the good word of God, and the powers of the age that is come, and fell
away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, seeing they
individually impale the Son of God afresh and put him to open
shame&rdquo; (vi. 5, 6). The believers are &ldquo;not of them that
shrink back into perdition&rdquo; (x. 39); and they are warned to look
carefully &ldquo;whether there be any man that falleth back from the
grace of God<span class="corr" id="xd21e2774" title=
"Source: .">,</span>... like Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his
own birthright&rdquo; (xii. 15, 16). The words &ldquo;tasted,&rdquo;
&ldquo;perdition,&rdquo; &ldquo;sold,&rdquo; might start a legend of
the betrayal, first alluded to by Paul (if 1 Cor. xi. 23 be genuine,
which is doubtful), though had the legend of Judas then existed this
writer would naturally have alluded to him along with Esau.</p>
<p>This Epistle is the nursery of the titles of Christ; he is Apostle,
Son of God, Son of Man, Great Shepherd, Captain of Salvation, Mediator,
Great High Priest; and here alone is found the now familiar endearing
phrase &ldquo;Our Lord.&rdquo; These titles represent the functions of
different beings in the Avesta. The conception of the work of Jesus on
earth is largely Zoroastrian. The Majesty on high has a colony and a
people on earth, which otherwise is under the supremacy of the Evil
One. As we have seen the Avestan definitions of Ahuramazda and Angra
Mainyu, &ldquo;the Living and the Not Living,&rdquo; are reflected in
the phrases of this Epistle,&mdash;the &ldquo;Power of Imperishable
Life&rdquo; (vii. 16) and the &ldquo;Power of Death&rdquo; (ii. 14).
Ahuramazda, when his &ldquo;habitable earth&rdquo; was prepared,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>brought into it his &ldquo;first-born,&rdquo;
Yima, and wished him to propagate the divine law which should destroy
the power of Angra Mainyu on earth and confine him in the underworld.
Yima replied, &ldquo;I was not born, I was not taught, to be the
preacher and the bearer of thy law.&rdquo; He engaged, however, to
enlarge and nourish the garden of God on earth, of which he was king,
and entitled &ldquo;the good shepherd.&rdquo; He obtained from the Holy
Spirit, An&acirc;hita, the powers thus enumerated in Ab&acirc;n Yast
26: &ldquo;He begged of her a boon, saying, &lsquo;Grant me this, O
good, most beneficent Ardvi S&ucirc;ra An&acirc;hita, that I may become
the sovereign lord of all countries, of the d&aelig;vas [devils] and
men, of the Y&acirc;tus [sorcerers] and Pairkas [seducing nymphs], of
the oppressors [who afflict] the blind and the deaf; and that I may
take from the d&aelig;vas [devils] both riches and welfare, both
fatness and flocks, both weal and glory&rdquo; [hvaren&ocirc;,
&ldquo;the glory from above which makes the king an earthly
god&rdquo;].<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2781src" href="#xd21e2781"
name="xd21e2781src">3</a> This &ldquo;firstborn&rdquo; reigned a
thousand years, but then, having ascribed his &ldquo;glory&rdquo; to
the demons from whom he obtained wealth and material benefits, his
&ldquo;glory&rdquo; was lost, and secured by the Devil, who reigned in
his place a thousand years, blighting the world, when Zoroaster was
born to undertake the establishment of the divine Law on earth. Yima
was ultimately developed into the Jamshid of Persian mythology, whose
power over demons, fabulous wealth, and ultimate fall (through
declaring himself a god, according to Firdusi) invested the legend of
Solomon.</p>
<p>From the legend of Solomon and the Solomonic Psalms the Epistle to
the Hebrews brings its exaltation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139"
href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>of Christ. From Ps. lxxxix.
26&ndash;7, as reproduced in 2 Sam. vii. 14, is quoted (i. 5) the
divine promise, &ldquo;I will be to him (Solomon) a Father and he shall
be my Son,&rdquo; along with the manifesto at Solomon&rsquo;s
enthronement (Ps. ii. 7), &ldquo;Thou art my Son; this day have I
begotten thee.&rdquo; Solomon is the &ldquo;first-born&rdquo; alluded
to in Heb. i. 6: &ldquo;When of old bringing the first-born into the
inhabited earth (<span class="trans" title=
"oikoumen&#275;n"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&omicron;&#7984;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;&mu;&#8051;&nu;&eta;&nu;</span></span>)
he saith, And pay homage to him all angels of God?<span class="corr"
id="xd21e2799" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>And here we have an interesting example of evolution in the Solomon
legend. The term &ldquo;first-born,&rdquo; as indicating the relation
of a human being to the deity, occurs but once in the Old Testament,
namely, in Psalm lxxxix. 27. It occurs in a strange passage that must
be quoted:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">19. Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy ones,</p>
<p class="line">And saidst, I have laid help upon a youth;</p>
<p class="line">I have raised <i>one</i> elected out of the people.</p>
<p class="line">20. I have discovered David, my servant:</p>
<p class="line">With my holy oil have I anointed him,</p>
<p class="line">21. By whom my hand shall be established,</p>
<p class="line">Whom also mine arm shall strengthen.</p>
<p class="line">22. The enemy shall not do him violence,</p>
<p class="line">Nor the son of evil afflict him.</p>
<p class="line">23. I will beat down his adversaries before him</p>
<p class="line">And smite them that hate him.</p>
<p class="line">24. But my faithfulness and my mercy <i>end not</i>
with him,</p>
<p class="line">And in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>
<p class="line">25. I will extend his hand on the sea also,</p>
<p class="line">And his right hand on the rivers:</p>
<p class="line">26. He shall address me, &ldquo;Thou, my father,</p>
<p class="line">My God, and the rock of my support&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="line">27. In answer I constitute him first-born,</p>
<p class="line">Elyon of the kings of the earth.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Although in all of these verses the Davidic royalty is
exalted, the reference to David&rsquo;s own reign passes at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>verse 24 into a celebration of Solomon. Here, as
in Psalm cxxxii. 17, Solomon is the &ldquo;horn&rdquo; of David: he was
distinctively the power on sea and river, phrases inapplicable to
David, and there is a contrast between the anointed
&ldquo;servant&rdquo; (verse 20) and the &ldquo;first-born&rdquo;
(verse 27). The next title, &ldquo;Elyon&rdquo; (Most High), comes very
near to that of the deity (El Elyon) of the mysterious priest-king of
Salem, Melchizedek, whose mythical character and identity with the
legendary Solomon will be hereafter considered.</p>
<p>Here we have no doubt the germs of the narrative in 2 Sam. vii. of
the formal adoption of Solomon as Jahveh&rsquo;s son, with the addition
of a metaphysical connotation of the sonship not found in the Psalm. In
the Psalm the fatherhood is that of support, the position of
&ldquo;first-born&rdquo; is that of chieftainship among kings; and it
is further said (31, 32) that if any of the sons of the Davidic line
profane the divine statutes, &ldquo;Then will I visit their
transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.&rdquo; But
in 2 Sam. vii. 14, Jahveh applies this warning to Solomon alone, and
with a remarkable modification: &ldquo;I will be his father and he
shall be my son: if he commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod
of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men; but my mercy shall not
depart from him.&rdquo; That is, though a son of God he may be
chastened like the sons of men,&mdash;an intimation of a difference
between Solomon and ordinary human nature not intended in the words of
the Psalm.</p>
<p>The Epistle to the Hebrews, finding in this Psalm an introduction of
&ldquo;first-born&rdquo; into the world, for there is no article
preceding the word, follows it so closely as to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>omit
any article before &ldquo;son&rdquo; (i. 2). He finds this in an
address of the deity to his angels (&ldquo;holy ones&rdquo; or saints),
and understands verse 27 of the Psalm to mean that they, the angels,
are to worship the &ldquo;first-born&rdquo; as the Elyon, or Most High
on earth. From 2 Sam. vii. the Epistle gets sufficient authority for
ascribing an eternal personality to the sonship, anciently represented
by Solomon, and we may thus see that the gesture of Hebrew religion
towards a doctrine of incarnation was much earlier than is generally
supposed. And this, too, is the Hebrew contribution to a Psalm which,
in the nine verses above quoted, imports ideas foreign to Judaism. The
reciprocal help of the deity and the king (19&ndash;21) is Avestan, and
inconsistent with monotheism. Elyon is the name of an ancient
Ph&oelig;nician god, slain by his son El, no doubt the
&ldquo;first-born of death&rdquo; in Job xviii. 13, and the violent
&ldquo;son of evil,&rdquo; in verse 22 of our Psalm. The exaltation of
both David and Solomon in the Psalm is primarily in reference to
service and deeds, not majesty, essence, or title; of these Avestan
religion made little, but Hebraism made much, and the deification of
Solomon, though warranted by other Psalms, is added to this
eighty-ninth by Samuel and the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
<p>In Ecclesiasticus it is written: &ldquo;In the division of the
nations of the whole earth he set a ruler over every people; but Israel
is the Lord&rsquo;s portion: whom, being his first-born, he nourisheth
with discipline, and giving him the light of his love doth not forsake
him.... For all things cannot be in men, because the son of man is not
immortal. What is brighter than the sun? Yet the light thereof faileth;
and flesh and blood will imagine evil&rdquo; (xvii.). Now in the
Zoroastrian theology <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>there could be no direct contact of God
with matter: the devil&rsquo;s empire could be invaded and death
conquered only by a perfectly &ldquo;blameless&rdquo; <span class=
"sc">Man</span>. (Cf. &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon,&rdquo; xviii. 21, with
the &ldquo;sinless&rdquo; of Heb. iv. 15, the &ldquo;guileless&rdquo;
of vii. 26, and &ldquo;without blemish,&rdquo; ix. 14). The spotless
one can use no carnal weapon. In the Zoroastrian theology the divine
potency is that of the Word, and formulas exist to be wielded against
every variety of demon. So in this Epistle the supremacy of the Son is
by &ldquo;the word of his power&rdquo;, (i. 3), and &ldquo;the Word of
God is sharper than any two-edged sword&rdquo; (iv. 12).</p>
<p>The enterprise of the Son of God was to fulfil these conditions. He
must become a complete man, share all the infirmities of man, all his
liabilities to temptation, receive no assistance from his Father, no
angelic help,&mdash;placed lower than the angels,&mdash;and confront
the powers of Death and Hell without any material weapon. If he
succeeded in remaining sinless, faithful to the divine law, even unto
death, even while in hell, unshaken by threats, sufferings, or
seductions, it must be a purely human achievement. There was no
miracle; even the suspicion of using supernatural power would have
tainted the whole work of Jesus as conceived in this Epistle.</p>
<p>This undertaking was not simply for the sake of mankind. All things
are not yet subjected to the divine sway (Heb. ii. 8). Heaven itself
was shaken, when the old covenant failed, and trembled for the result
of the tremendous conflict of the Son of Man on earth with its Prince
and his hosts (Heb. xii. 25&ndash;29). This was &ldquo;the joy in front
of him&rdquo; (xii. 2), as well as the rescue of men. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus was the man left entirely to the devil, not even his life being
reserved, as in the case of Job. He loudly cries for help, even with
tears, at the sight of Death; he is heard, pitied, but no help comes.
He must trust to his human merits, and not miracles, for his Sonship is
of no value in this conflict. By his obedience learned in his
sufferings, by his sinlessness under all trials and temptations, he
fulfilled the conditions of deathlessness. By his own heart&rsquo;s
blood, not by offerings of bloody sacrifices, not by supernatural
power, he reached the place of holiness, &ldquo;having obtained eternal
redemption.&rdquo; From first to last there was no divine aid. His
unanswered loud cries (Heb. v. 7) may be connected with the legend of
his expiring cry, &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of the thought here is similar to the &ldquo;Wisdom of
Solomon&rdquo; (ii. 22&ndash;4, iii. 1&ndash;9), where however the
ideas are conflicting. It is said, &ldquo;God created man to be
immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity:
nevertheless, through the devil&rsquo;s envy came death into the world,
and they that hold of his side do find it.&rdquo; But then Jahvism puts
in with the declaration that the seeming destruction of the righteous
is God&rsquo;s chastisement and probation of them. The Epistle to the
Hebrews does not regard the sufferings and death of Jesus as
God&rsquo;s work at all, but all from the devil. Though God spoke by
him there is no suggestion that he sent Jesus, or that his coming was
not voluntary.</p>
<p>With this reservation, and a large one it is, that Jesus was not
delivered up to Satan by God, but left to confront his torments in an
effort to subdue him, &ldquo;bring him to nought,&rdquo; the central
idea of the Epistle is a doctrinal transfiguration of Job, who being
delivered up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>to Satan, triumphs over the tempter and
tormentor, and through all preserves his sinlessness and loyalty to
God. The result being that those who had denied Job&rsquo;s merits, his
sinlessness, had to secure Job&rsquo;s intercession in order to escape
the penalty of having ascribed his sufferings to God (Job xlii.
8).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2881src" href="#xd21e2881" name=
"xd21e2881src">4</a> This relationship of ideas is all the more
interesting because apparently unconscious in the writer of the
Epistle, and thus revealing the extent to which Oriental religion had
remoulded Judaism among the educated Jews of his time. Monotheism is
strictly inconsistent with the supremacy of &ldquo;merits&rdquo; which
is the very soul of Oriental religion. The sacred books of India
contain records of saints or Rishis who by extraordinary austerities,
sacrifices, and virtues so piled up their &ldquo;merits&rdquo; that the
gods were frightened, as they were at the tower of Babel; and sometimes
the gods tempted these powerful saints to commit some sin that would
reduce their &ldquo;merits.&rdquo; The Solomonic &ldquo;Proverbs&rdquo;
are pervaded by the Oriental doctrine of &ldquo;merits&rdquo;: a man is
proved by test of his merits, as gold passing through the furnace
(xxvii. 21); the perfect inherit good (xxviii. 10); and perhaps that
sublime pedlar of transcendent gems imported along with the gold of
Ophir some version of the Puranic legend of Harischandra, &ldquo;the
Hindu Job.&rdquo; All the Jahvist adulterations of the biblical version
do not conceal the fact that when Jahveh, by delivering the meritorious
man up to Satan, delivered himself also into the hands of Satan, he
(Jahveh) was compelled to surrender before the merits on which the man
had planted himself. Jahveh reclaimed his sovereignty, but agreed that
Job, who had said &ldquo;God hath wronged <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>me,&rdquo; had spoken
of him &ldquo;the thing that is right&rdquo; (xlii. 8). In the same way
the storm-god Indra (the Hindu Jahveh) accompanied by all the gods,
headed by Dharma (Justice), appears to Harischandra after his trials,
and tells him that he, his wife and son, had, by their merits,
&ldquo;conquered heaven&rdquo; (<i>Markandeya Purana</i>). The
completion of these merits was when Harischandra resolved with his wife
to die on the funeral pyre of their son, who, as a result of their
torments, had died by a serpent&rsquo;s bite. It was then that the god
Indra appeared to restore the son, and admit that the just and faithful
king, his wife and son, had &ldquo;conquered heaven.&rdquo; We are thus
carried to the Solomonic affirmations that &ldquo;when the whirlwind
passeth the just man is on an everlasting foundation&rdquo; (Prov. x.
25), that &ldquo;justice delivereth from death&rdquo; (x. 2), that
&ldquo;the just man finds a refuge in death&rdquo; (xiv. 32); and we
are carried forward to the Epistle to the Hebrews, where, after the
last ordeal, death, the son of the heavenly king is restored to life,
and Satan, who had over him the power of death, &ldquo;brought to
nought&rdquo; (ii. 14). But further, in the Puranic legend, which from
time immemorial has been a passion-play in India, Harischandra, when
told that he, his wife and son, had &ldquo;conquered heaven,&rdquo;
refused to ascend to heaven without his &ldquo;faithful
subjects.&rdquo; &ldquo;This request was granted by Indra, and after
Viswamitra had inaugurated Rohitaswa, the king&rsquo;s son, to be his
successor, Harischandra, his friends and followers, all ascended to
heaven.&rdquo; Thus, in our Epistle, the son, having &ldquo;learned
obedience by the things which he suffered, and having been made
perfect, became unto all them that obeyed him the author of eternal
salvation.&rdquo; &ldquo;For in that he hath himself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>suffered being tempted, he is able to succor
them that are tempted.&rdquo; The subjects of King Harischandra who
remained faithful to him after he was reduced to beggary, ascended with
him. Faith is declared in our Epistle to be &ldquo;the testing of
things not seen&rdquo; (xi. 1), and faithfulness is to &ldquo;run with
patience the course that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the
captain and perfector of faithfulness, who for the joy set before him
endured the stake (<span class="trans" title="stauron"><span class=
"Greek" lang=
"el">&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&#8057;&nu;</span></span>),
despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of
God&rdquo; (xi. 1, xii. 1, 2).</p>
<p>And there is also, I believe, in the scheme of redemption set forth
in this Epistle, an influence from the story of King Usin&aacute;ra in
the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, of which there were various versions
which must have been familiar to the Buddhists in Alexandria. A dove
pursued by a falcon takes refuge in the bosom of Usin&aacute;ra; the
falcon demands its surrender. The King quotes the law of Manu that it
is a great sin to abandon any being that has taken asylum with one. The
falcon urges that it is the law of nature that falcons shall feed on
doves, and that unless this dove is surrendered its little falcons must
starve. The King offers other food, but the only substitute that is
adapted to the falcon&rsquo;s nature is a quantity of
Usin&aacute;ra&rsquo;s own flesh equal to the weight of the dove. To
this the King agrees. Balances are produced, and the dove placed in one
scale, in the other a piece of the King&rsquo;s flesh, which seems
large enough, but is insufficient. Though the King cuts off piece by
piece all of his flesh, the dove outweighs it, until at length
Usin&aacute;ra gets into the scale <span class="sc">Himself</span>.
That outweighs the dove, which is really Agni, the falcon being Indra.
The gods who had assumed these forms in order <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>to
test Usin&aacute;ra&rsquo;s fidelity to the law of sanctuary, resume
their shape, and the King ascends transfigured to paradise. In one
version a King (Givi) sacrifices his son, Vrihad-Gasbha in obedience to
sacred requirements, the story resembling that of Abraham and Isaac.
Alford calls attention to the emphasis on the word
&ldquo;himself&rdquo; in the Epistle of the Hebrews ix. 14: &ldquo;How
much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit
offered <span class="sc">Himself</span>, without blemish, unto God,
cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without blemish! That was the great point. The champion of the Good
confronts the champion of Evil, his purpose being to conquer the last
enemy, Death, by unarmed human virtue. This was the central idea in the
Passion, a drama gone to pieces in the Gospels. Therefore, he did not
summon legions of angels, and said to Peter, &ldquo;Sheath thy
sword.&rdquo; Therefore, the mere lynching of Jesus, for such it was,
is given the formalities of judicial procedure, in order to impress an
official character on the testimonies to his innocence: Pilate,
Caiaphas, Pilate&rsquo;s wife, Judas, Herod, all bear witness that no
evil is in him, and he challenges the High Priest&rsquo;s court,
&ldquo;If I have uttered evil bear witness of the evil.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2912src" href="#xd21e2912" name="xd21e2912src">5</a>
In this passion-drama Jesus Barabbas is set beside Jesus the
Christ,&mdash;officially proclaimed guilt beside officially proclaimed
innocence,&mdash;and Wrath selects guilt, condemns innocence. But it
was thus the first-born of Life prevailed over the first-born
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>of Death. In that crisis the blameless man
swerving not from his rectitude, established the &ldquo;assembly of the
first-born,&rdquo; who can dwell with the living God because they have
learned from their Captain how to get rid of the defilement of
mortality. There is nothing vicarious in his service. The Captain
represented the human race in a single combat with Satan, and he
discovered for all the vulnerable point of that Adversary,&mdash;that
he could not hold in sheol a perfectly sinless human being. But it
still remained that without holiness no man could see the Lord. Another
advantage secured by Jesus for men was that after his victory was
achieved the heroic man, on resuming his previous position as Son of
God, was able to add thereto what he had won as Son of Man,&mdash;the
office of high priest or intercessor, who could take good care that
every man who fulfilled the condition of holiness got his reward. Satan
should not cheat. Nevertheless Jesus had been his own saviour, and
every man must be his own saviour.</p>
<p>Pulpit ignorance has wrested from the Epistle to the Hebrews
fragments of texts, in support of a dogma of atonement which only a
fortunate lack of logic prevents from amounting to a doctrine of human
sacrifice. A favorite clause is, &ldquo;Without the shedding of blood
there in no remission,&rdquo;&mdash;which is really this
epistle&rsquo;s stigma on the system it is abolishing! The sacredness
of the blood of Jesus was that it was the price he had to pay to the
devil in order to preserve his sinlessness, and so rise from death, and
demonstrate to others that they also could rise by sinlessness to
eternal life. It might cost their blood also, but would be lost if they
&ldquo;resisted unto blood.&rdquo; Jesus thus brought life and
incorruption, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>as distinguished from living-death in sheol, to
light. And the devotion to Jesus for this was due to the belief that he
had laid aside his heavenly glory and become a complete man, and had
thus risked his all, his greatness, his very immortality, to make for
both heaven and earth the tremendous venture; the slightest misstep,
the least sin, or wrath, or impatience, and he would have had his abode
in sheol, in bonds of Satan, through all eternity.</p>
<p>When this Epistle was written the believers already found
immortality in such faith; with such hope and joy before them they were
able to despise sensual joys, to conquer temptations, and to fulfill
those duties and conditions of personal holiness which are described in
this Epistle,&mdash;&ldquo;Peace with all men, and holiness without
which no man can see the Lord.&rdquo; The ecstasy did not last long,
but it was a marvellous phenomenon while it lasted, and the most
complete reflection of it may be found in this Epistle to the Hebrews,
especially if it be approached by its prologue,&mdash;the &ldquo;Wisdom
of Solomon,&rdquo;&mdash;but it is subtle, and can only be comprehended
by patient and comparative studies.</p>
<p>At the heart of this earliest and swiftly lost Christianity was a
sublime effort to humanize God. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150"

this work was sent to the press the world has been enriched by Dr.
McGiffert&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Christianity in the Apostolic
Age.&rdquo; He pronounces the unknown author of the Epistle to the
Hebrews &ldquo;without doubt the finest and most cultured literary
genius of the primitive church,&rdquo; but believes the Epistle to be
somewhat later than those of Paul. He thinks its detailed description
of proceedings in the temple might have been written after its
destruction, as Clement&rsquo;s account was, and remarks that the
writer always calls it the &ldquo;tabernacle.&rdquo; This peculiarity I
attribute to the emphasis in the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; on the
temple being &ldquo;a resemblance of the holy tabernacle which thou
hast prepared from the beginning&rdquo; (ix. 8). It seems unlikely that
the Epistle could have said &ldquo;the priests go in continually&rdquo;
etc., had the temple not existed. Dr. McGiffert finds in some
expressions indications that there were Gentiles among those to whom
the Epistle was addressed, but even admitting this it is natural to
suppose that there must have been some fellowship of this kind among
educated people before Paul&rsquo;s propaganda. The passages referred
to by Dr. McGiffert, if they imply what he supposes, render it all the
more improbable that if Paul and his mission to the Gentiles preceded
this Epistle, there should be no allusion to them in it.</p>

<p class="first">It is possible that the genealogies of Jesus started
from no other basis than Hebrews vii. 14: &ldquo;It is clear beforehand
that our Lord hath arisen out of Judah.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2937src" href="#xd21e2937" name="xd21e2937src">1</a> Yet nothing
could be more subversive of the Epistle than a claim of any hereditary
authority or advantage for Jesus.</p>
<p>The author of the Epistle, if he ever heard the phrase &ldquo;Son of
David,&rdquo; avoided it, for David is here in the background, and in a
quotation from one of his Psalms his name is passed over, with the
vague words, &ldquo;one hath testified somewhere, saying,&rdquo; etc.
It is an essential part of the writer&rsquo;s argument that Christ is
&ldquo;without genealogy&rdquo; of that kind. To some it was no doubt
grateful to be told that Jesus was not of the priestly tribe, not of
that &ldquo;apostolic succession,&rdquo; so to say; but it was more
important to convince the conservative that their sacred history
sanctioned faith in a high priest approved as such not by carnal
descent, but by his sinlessness and by his resurrection. But it was not
agreeable to any Jewish party to suppose that the new dominion was to
be altogether in the heavens, or detached from the Solomonic Golden Age
for whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>return they were hoping. The writer therefore
connects Jesus with a &ldquo;first-born&rdquo; forerunner, namely, with
Melchizedek, concerning whom he &ldquo;has many things to say, and hard
of interpretation.&rdquo; So Christian commentators have to this day
found what he does say, and Melchizedek is not surrounded by any
dogmatic fence that can turn a new hypothesis into a trespass.</p>
<p>The Epistle applies to Jesus lines from Psalm cx.:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Thou art a priest for ever,</p>
<p class="line">After the order of Melchizedek.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But in this anonymous Psalm there is reason to believe
that Melchizedek is not a proper name at all. It is admittedly a
combination of <i>malki&rsquo;-tzedek</i>, &ldquo;king of
justice,&rdquo; and in the Jewish Family Bible (Deusch) the above lines
are translated, &ldquo;Thou <i>art</i> my priest for ever, my king in
righteousness, by my word.&rdquo; The Septuagint, regularly followed by
the Epistle to the Hebrews, has Melchizedek in this Psalm cx., which
was also messianized by the LXX. in its very first line, &ldquo;The
Lord said unto my Lord,&rdquo; <span class="trans" title=
"Kyrios"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&#8055;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span> being
the word for Lord in both cases, whereas in the original the words are
different (&ldquo;Jahveh declared to my Adonai&rdquo;). And it is
notable that Matthew xxii. whose Hebraic character is so marked, and
Mark xii., both make Jesus follow the Septuagint in quoting these
words.</p>
<p>In both of these Gospels the incident is evidently, in Mark
clumsily, interpolated, and it would appear to have belonged to some
legend of the Infancy, such as that of the Arabic Gospel of the
Infancy, where it occurs naturally:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And when he was twelve years old they took him
to Jerusalem to the feast. But when the feast was over they indeed
returned, but the Lord Jesus remained in the temple among <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>the
doctors and elders and learned men of Jerusalem, and he asked them
sundry questions about the sciences and they answered him in turn. Now
he said to them, Whose son is Messiah? They answered him, The son of
David. Wherefore, then, said he, Doth he in spirit call him Lord, when
he saith the Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, that I
may bring down thy enemies to the footprints of thy feet?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It is probable that this anecdote had floated down from an early
period when the notion of a royal descent of Jesus had not arisen.</p>
<p>Obviously a tremendous question arises here as to how a story should
be found in Genesis xiv. about Melchizedek, which as a proper name
really occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2987src" href="#xd21e2987" name="xd21e2987src">2</a> and the
mystery is increased by the absence of any allusion to such a personage
in Jesus Ben Sira&rsquo;s enumeration of &ldquo;famous men&rdquo;
(Ecclus. xliv.), or elsewhere. It almost looks as if Jesus Ben Sira had
not read, or else had cancelled as spurious, the strange passage in
Genesis&mdash;which is as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And Melchizedek, King of Salem, brought forth
bread and wine; and he was priest of El-Ely&ocirc;n. And he blessed him
and said, Blessed be Abram of El-Ely&ocirc;n, purchaser of heaven and
earth; and blessed be El-Ely&ocirc;n, which hath delivered thine
enemies into thy hand. And he (Abram) gave him a tenth of
all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller, in his third lecture on the
&ldquo;Science of Religion,&rdquo; gives some useful information
concerning this peculiar name, &ldquo;El-Ely&ocirc;n,&rdquo; after
consulting his contemporaries at Oxford and in Germany:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the oldest names of the deity among the ancestors of
the Semitic nations was <i>El</i>. It meant Strong. It occurs in the
Babylonian inscriptions as Ilu, God, and in the very name of Bab-il,
the gate or temple of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>Il.... The same El was worshipped
at Byblus by the Ph&oelig;nicians, and he was called there the Son of
Heaven and Earth. His father was the son of <i>Eliun</i>, the most high
God, who had been killed by wild animals. The Son of Eliun, who
succeeded him, was dethroned, and at last slain by his own son,
<i>El</i>, whom Philo identifies with the Greek Kronos, and represents
as the presiding deity of the planet Saturn.... <i>Ely&ocirc;n</i>,
which, in Hebrew, means the Highest is used in the Old Testament as a
predicate of God.... It occurs in the Ph&oelig;nician cosmogony as
<i>Eliun</i>, the highest God, the Father of Heaven, who was the father
of <i>El</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Sanchunvaton (Euseb. Pr&oelig;p. i. 10) the
Ph&oelig;nicians called God <span class="trans" title=
"Elioun"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&#8166;&nu;</span></span>.</p>
<p>The combination El Ely&ocirc;n occurs in but two chapters in the
Bible,&mdash;Genesis xiv. and Psalm lxxviii. (The Revisers translate it
in Genesis, &ldquo;God Most High,&rdquo; but in the Psalm (verse 35),
&ldquo;Most High God.&rdquo;) That the name was imported from the
earlier into the later chapter is suggested by a similar association of
each with the idea of purchase or redemption: &ldquo;God Most High,
purchaser of heaven and earth&rdquo; (Genesis), &ldquo;God Most High,
their redeemer&rdquo; (Psalm). But which is the earlier? Probably the
Psalm; for it is a long r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the traditional history
of Israel, but contains no allusion to Abraham. Had its unique name,
&ldquo;El Ely&ocirc;n,&rdquo; been derived from any such traditional
source surely some mention of Abraham would have been made.</p>
<p>The Psalm is Elohistic. Possibly the Ph&oelig;nician name for God,
Elioun, was used in order to set &ldquo;El&rdquo; above it. Or it may
be that as Solomon had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>declared &ldquo;Ely&ocirc;n of
Kings&rdquo; (Psalm lxxxix. 27) it was important to recall that he at
the same time said, &ldquo;My Elohim,&rdquo; and to place
&ldquo;El&rdquo; before his title. This conjecture is warranted by the
fact that in both of the Psalms, and in the corresponding passages, God
is spoken of as a &ldquo;Rock.&rdquo; There are other resemblances
between the two Psalms, one very striking:</p>
<p>Psalm lxxviii. 70&mdash;&ldquo;He chose David also, his servant, and
took him from the sheepfolds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Psalm lxxxix. 19, 20&mdash;&ldquo;I have raised one elected out of
the people; I have discovered David, my servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Psalm in which the Septuagint personalises
<i>malki&rsquo;-tzedek</i> (cx.) into &ldquo;Melchizedek&rdquo; is a
fragmentary little piece, with two incomprehensible verses at the end
which seem to allude to some legend or folklore now lost. These verses
(6 and 7) are incongruous with the preceding ones and must be detached,
and perhaps verse 5 also, as this seems an anti-climax. These closing
verses look as if they may have been added by some admirer of
Joshua&rsquo;s slaughter of kings, and it is probable that the legend
of Joshua&rsquo;s making his captains tread on the necks of the five
kings (Joshua x.) was developed out of the opening verse of this
Psalm:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Jahveh said to my lord [Adonai], Sit thou
at my right hand,</p>
<p class="line">Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The leader of these kings was Adonai-Zedek, who, like
Melchizedek, was King of Jerusalem; they are certainly mythical
relatives, their names meaning &ldquo;Lord of Justice&rdquo; and
&ldquo;King of Justice.&rdquo; It is philologically impossible that any
persons with those proper names could have existed in Jerusalem before
the invasion of the Hebrews. And &ldquo;Adonai-bezek,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;radiant lord,&rdquo; whose thumbs and toes Joshua cut off when
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>captured Jerusalem, is a transparent variant of
Adonai-zedek.</p>
<p>When the city, originally named Jebus, began to be called Salem (see
Psalm lxxvi. 2), the aboriginal people who continued to dwell there
might naturally dream of their ancient kings, as the Welch and Bretons
so long did of Arthur, &ldquo;flower of kings,&rdquo; and perhaps
similarly expect their return to restore their ancient freedom; and it
may have become a useful political device to find beyond the ugly
legends of Joshua&rsquo;s cruelty to their &ldquo;just&rdquo; and
&ldquo;shining&rdquo; lords a prettier one, made out of an old song, of
an earlier &ldquo;King of Justice,&rdquo; whose bread and wine Abraham
had eaten, to whom he had paid tithes, whose deity, El Ely&ocirc;n, the
father of Israel had recognized as his own, and with whom he had made a
treaty of <i>salem</i>, or peace,&mdash;Jebus thus becoming Jebus-Salem
(Jerusalem).</p>
<p>Josephus records the legend as it was no doubt generally accepted
among the Jews in the first century of our era: &ldquo;Now, the King of
Sodom met him (Abram) at a certain place which they called the
King&rsquo;s Dale, where Melchizedek, King of the City of Salem,
received him. That name signifies the righteous king, and such he was
without dispute, insomuch that on that account he was made the priest
of God. However, they afterward called Salem Jerusalem.&rdquo; (Antiq.
Bk. i. ch. 10.)</p>
<p>Josephus is careful to identify Salem as Jerusalem, and in vi. ch.
10 of the same work states that the King&rsquo;s Dale (identified as
the Shaveh where Abraham met Melchizedek, Genesis xiv.) is &ldquo;two
furlongs distant from Jerusalem.&rdquo; This carefulness may have been
intended to distinguish Melchizedek&rsquo;s Salem from the northern
Shalem (Genesis xxxiii. 18), a place associated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>with
Jacob, and apparently representing an attempt to set up a rival temple
to that in Jerusalem. It was an old competition about tithes. Abraham
paid tithes to Melchizedek, King of Salem, but Jacob, after his vision
at Bethel, recognized that as the &ldquo;house of God,&rdquo; and vowed
to give to God a tenth of all that was given him (Genesis
xxviii).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3066src" href="#xd21e3066" name=
"xd21e3066src">3</a> This quarrel between rival towns and temples,
trying each to draw all tithes to themselves, harmonized in the later
legends of the Bible, need not detain us, but it is of importance to
remark that the story of Abram meeting the King of Justice and Peace
near Jerusalem, and establishing the sanctity of that city, corresponds
with, and is counterbalanced by, Jacob&rsquo;s meeting with angels, and
wrestling with a mysterious &ldquo;man,&rdquo; who, it is hinted, was
some form of God himself. This reply to the story of Abram suggests
that at the time of that tithe controversy between Bethel and Sion
Melchizedek was not thought of as a flesh-and-blood king or a mere man,
but as a shadowy shape, evoked from actual conditions for certain
purposes, and named in accordance with the history or traditions out of
which the conditions and the aims were evolved. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>In investigations of this kind, concerned with ages really
prehistoric, it is necessary to remember at every step that our search
is amid eras when words and names were at once counters of actual
forces and factors of history. How serious a play on words may be even
in historic times is illustrated by a Papacy founded on the double
meaning of <i>Peter</i>&mdash;a man&rsquo;s name and a rock,&mdash;and
as we approach earlier epochs, whose issues and struggles have long
passed away, and their once antagonistic leaders harmonised by pious
legends, it is largely by the aid of words and names that we are
enabled to reach even historic probabilities.</p>
<p>As to Melchizedek, my inference above stated, derived from the two
tithe legends, that his supernatural character is reflected in that of
the corresponding phantoms met by Jacob may not be generally accepted,
but that he (Melchizedek) was so understood by the writer to the
Hebrews can hardly be disputed. Melchizedek is there (Hebrews vii.)
declared to have been &ldquo;without father, without mother, without
genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, being
assimilated unto the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the third century the Melchizedekian sect maintained that
Melchizedek was not a man but a heavenly power superior to Jesus, and
the Hieracites held similar views. Some eminent theologians have
believed that Melchizedek was Christ himself. Most of the Christian
theories concerning the mysterious king are virtual admissions that
only the eye of faith can see in him any actual being at all. How then
was this mythical being formed?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3098src"
href="#xd21e3098" name="xd21e3098src">4</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>1. A suitable nest for the Melchizedek Saga existed near Jerusalem,
in a vale called the King&rsquo;s Dale. It seems to have been a royal
racing ground (Targum of Onkelos, Gen. xiv. 17) or hippodrome (lxx.
xlviii. 7), and its name in Hebrew was Emek-ham-<i>Melech</i>.</p>
<p>2. In the ancient Psalm cx. 1 we have Adonai (Lord), and in verse 4
<i>Melchi</i>-Melech (or Moloch) king, combined with <i>tsedek</i>,
justice.</p>
<p>3. <i>Tzedek</i> (Tsaydoc or Zadok), the priest who anointed Solomon
to be king. Tsaydoc supplanted the legitimate High Priest Abiathar who
had taken the side of the legitimate heir to David&rsquo;s throne,
Adonijah, supplanted by Solomon. The deprivation of Abiathar, and
exaltation of Tsaydoc to be High Priest is said (1 Kings ii. 27) to
have been in fulfillment of &ldquo;the word of Jahveh, which he spake
concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.&rdquo; The reference is to the
sentence passed on Eli and his house, to which Abiathar belonged, when
Jahveh said, &ldquo;And I will raise me up a faithful priest,
etc.,&rdquo; (1 Sam. ii. 35). Faithful priests <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>were
called &ldquo;sons of Zadok,&rdquo; the phrase having apparently become
proverbial (Ezek. xliv. 15).</p>
<p>4. In 1 Chron. iii. there appear, among the descendants of Solomon,
&ldquo;Amaziah, Azariah his son, Jotham his son.&rdquo; In 1 Chron. vi.
we find among descendants of Zadok, Ahimaaz, Azariah his son, Johanan
his son. Johanan is also among Solomon&rsquo;s descendants, and among
the descendants of both Solomon and Zadok is Shallum,&mdash;written by
Josephus Salloumos (Bk. x. ch. 8). Josephus also says that Zadok was
the first High Priest of Solomon&rsquo;s Temple. But Solomon himself,
without the assistance of any priest, dedicated the Temple, offered the
sacrifices on that occasion, and so continued: &ldquo;three times in a
year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the
altar which he built to Jahveh.&rdquo; (1 Kings ix. 25). These
statements establish a probability that no such person as Zadok existed
at all, and that the development of this personification of justice
(zedek) into a priestly personage was due to an ecclesiastical
necessity of introducing a priest among the provisions of Solomon for
the temple. Zadok is thus a detachment from King Solomon of the
priestly functions he had discharged in the temple, according to the
book of Kings; and in 1 Chron. vi., where this personification is
completed, the Solomonic family names are found, as above, recurring as
descendants of the personification,&mdash;Zadok.</p>
<p>These names are the fossil remains of controversies with Shilonite
and Samaritan pretensions, which ended in consecrating the throne and
altar at Jerusalem, and they prove that the consecration was that of
justice and peace. Of these the Wise Man was typical. Solomon was the
model from whom all of these ideals were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>painted. His title,
Adonai, and his equity (Psalm xlv. 7, 11) are combined in Adonizedek,
his glory (Psalm xlv. 3, 4) is in Adonibezek; his high priesthood is
allegorized in Zadok; and in &ldquo;Melchizedek, King of Salem,&rdquo;
his supreme characters are summed up, &ldquo;King of Justice, Prince of
Peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a warlike age this peacefulness of a monarch was the great and
supernatural phenomenon. It is the very central idea of the whole
Solomonic legend. Solomon got his name from it, even the name with
Jahveh in it (Jedediah) being set aside; he was preferred above David
to build the temple, because David was a warrior; in building the
temple the peace was not broken even by the noise of a hammer, the
stones being all in shape, it seems by supernatural power, when taken
from the quarry, so as to be noiselessly fitted together; he would not
fight even those who were rending parts of his kingdom away. He was the
hero of the Beatitudes,&mdash;the gentle one who inherited the earth,
the one who hungered and thirsted for justice and was filled, the
peacemaker called the Son of God. It was he who first said, If thine
enemy hunger give him food, if he thirst give him drink. And all this
was allegorized in Melchizedek, who, when his country was invaded,
instead of joining the five kings who resisted, loved his enemy, gave
the invader food and drink.</p>
<p>We thus find Solomon,&mdash;the glorious cosmopolitan and
secularist, whose name Jahvism could not utter without a
shudder,&mdash;distributed in fable, legend, psalm, through Hexateuch
and Hagiographa, and finally transfigured into a type of divine and
eternal Sonship. Thus he appears in the Epistle to the Hebrews, to
which we now return. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161"
name="pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Epistle to the Hebrews Christ is invested with the mystical
robes of Solomon. To Christ are applied the words, &ldquo;I will be to
him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son,&rdquo; quoted from
Jahveh&rsquo;s promise to David concerning Solomon (2 Sam. vii. 14). To
Christ are twice applied the words, &ldquo;Thou art my Son, this day
have I begotten thee,&rdquo; quoted from Psalm ii. 7, admittedly
Solomonic. From Psalm xlv., verses 6 and 7, ascriptions to Solomon, are
applied to Christ in this Epistle. And Melchizedek is here declared to
be &ldquo;a great man,&rdquo; &ldquo;assimilated unto the Son of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may here recall the words of Josephus, a contemporary of our
writer, who says that Melchizedek was made the priest of God on account
of his righteousness (Ant., Bk. i. ch. 10). It may have been that there
was a popular belief in the time of Josephus that Melchizedek received
his ordination from Abram himself, but there is no doubt that the
mysterious king&rsquo;s priesthood was believed to rest upon his
righteousness and above all his peacefulness.</p>
<p>With these preliminaries we may find the Epistle&rsquo;s argument
about Melchizedek less &ldquo;hard of interpretation&rdquo; than the
writer says it is. After speaking of Abraham as having
&ldquo;obtained&rdquo; the promise, not merely because it was
God&rsquo;s promise, but because he &ldquo;patiently endured,&rdquo;
having argued that Christ, &ldquo;though he was a Son, yet learned
obedience by the things that he suffered&rdquo;, this Epistle maintains
(vi. 20) that this is the believer&rsquo;s hope, whereby he enters
within the veil, &ldquo;whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us,
having become a high priest forever after the manner of
Melchizedek.&rdquo; (The sense of this is lost in the E. V. by
rendering <span class="trans" title="genomenos"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"el">&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&#8057;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>
&ldquo;made&rdquo;: the argument is that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>though he was a Son
of God even that could not make him a high priest; this he had to
&ldquo;become&rdquo; by his own merits, uninheritable even from God, as
was the case with Melchizedek.) &ldquo;For this Melchizedek, being of
Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the
slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, to whom also Abraham divided a
tenth part of all (being first by interpretation King of Righteousness,
and next also King of Salem, that is Prince of Peace; being without
father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of
days nor end of life, but assimilated (<span class="trans" title=
"ech&#333;n aph&#333;moi&#333;menos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#7956;&chi;&omega;&nu;
&#7936;&phi;&omega;&mu;&omicron;&iota;&omega;&mu;&#8051;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>)
unto the Son of God), abideth a priest perpetually&rdquo; (vii.
1&ndash;3).</p>
<p>The mystical clauses of verse 3 have for centuries been an unsolved
enigma to exegetists; and Alford, after summing up the many conjectures
as to their meaning, expresses his feeling that the writer had a
thought which he did not intend us to comprehend! Probably, however,
the writer was using language understood in his time, and which may be
interpreted by comparison with expressions familiar in Jewish folklore.
Some of these are preserved in the apocryphal gospels. Thus, in the
Pseudo-Matthew, Levi, the teacher of Jesus, astounded by the
Child&rsquo;s learning, says, &ldquo;I think he was born before the
flood.&rdquo; In the gospel of Thomas, the teacher Zacch&aelig;us says,
&ldquo;This child is not of earthly parents, he is able to subdue even
fire. Perhaps he was begotten before the world was made.&rdquo; These
ideas, which correspond somewhat to the Teutonic superstition of the
&ldquo;changeling,&rdquo; are traceable in the Fourth Gospel (viii.
56&ndash;59), where Jesus is stoned for saying, &ldquo;Before Abraham
was I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be seen that by this early writer &ldquo;to the
Hebrews&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>Jesus was not thought of in connection with
David, but bore Solomon&rsquo;s pre&euml;minent title, King of Peace,
and that conferred on him by the Queen of Sheba, King of Justice. In
the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; the Prince of the Golden Age,
historically associated with idolatrous shrines, had been
rehabilitated, even apotheosized; he was now a sort of rival of Jesus
in divine sonship. The writer of our Epistle therefore artistically,
not to say artfully, utilizes a composite word made into a proper name
under which Solomon&rsquo;s combined royalty and priesthood, his peace
and justice, had been detached from his personality and personified.
The new exaltation of Solomon personally was thus ignored, while his
essential glories, his wisdom, and his reclaimed virtues, were woven
into the celestial mantle of mysterious Melchizedek, and through him
passed to the shoulders of the risen Christ. <span class=

&ldquo;Salem&rdquo; of Gen. xiv. 18, and the &ldquo;Shalem&rdquo; of
Gen. xxiii. 18, are evidently competitive. Also Jacob&rsquo;s naming
his altar &ldquo;El-Elohe-Israel&rdquo; seems an answer to
Abraham&rsquo;s &ldquo;El-Ely&ocirc;n,&rdquo; as if saying that the
latter was not the God of Israel. It is even possible that the name
&ldquo;Luz&rdquo; (Gen. xxviii. 19) changed to Beth-El, after
Jacob&rsquo;s vision of the Ladder and setting up the pillar there, is
meant to correspond with the &ldquo;oaks of Mamre&rdquo; (Gen. xiv.
13), where Abram dwelt when he was met by the priest of El Ely&ocirc;n.
For Abram had also built an altar at some place called Beth-El (Gen.
xiii. 3) where he called on the name of the Lord and received a promise
that his seed should be &ldquo;as the dust of the earth,&rdquo; which
is verbatim the promise made to Jacob at <i>his</i> Beth-El (Gen.
xxviii. 14). Now Abram next moves his tent to the &ldquo;oak of
Mamre&rdquo; in Hebron (Gen. xiii. 18), and the Hebrew word for oak is
<i>Elah</i>, or <i>Eylon</i>. The unusual name for the deity of both
Abram and Melchizedek, <i>El-Elyon</i>, was probably selected because
of its resemblance to the sacred oak or <i>Elah</i> of that place, and
Jacob&rsquo;s El-<i>Elohe</i>-Israel was no doubt meant to invest his
deity with the same sanctity. Now &ldquo;Luz&rdquo; also means a
tree,&mdash;almond-tree,&mdash;and was also a name of the Assyrian
goddess Ishtar. The oak was associated also with Jacob, who buried
beneath it the idols of his household (Gen. xxxv. 1&ndash;9)
immediately before setting up his altar at Luz (the almond).</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3098" href="#xd21e3098src" name="xd21e3098">4</a></span> It may
be said in passing, that the legend in Gen. xiv., as was first pointed
out in Calmet, bears some resemblance to the Hindu myth of Soma, a
lunar being, who discovered the juice of the sacred Soma plant
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Asclepias acida</i>), called &ldquo;the king of
plants.&rdquo; Soma was the most sacred sacrifice to the gods, as a
juice; it had the intoxicating effect of wine; and the lunar being,
Soma, was believed to be still alive, though invisible, and is the
chief of the sacerdotal tribe to this day. In the Vishnu Purana, Soma
is called &ldquo;the monarch of Brahmans.&rdquo; He was the Hindu
Bacchus, and is regarded as the guardian of healing plants and
constellations. Melchizedek, offering wine to, and as priest of God
Most High receiving tribute from, the &ldquo;High Father&rdquo;
(Abram), thus bears some resemblance to Soma, the sacerdotal moon-god;
and those who care to study the matter further may be reminded that in
Babylonian mythology Malkit seems to be a &ldquo;Queen of Heaven&rdquo;
(moon), and is connected by Goldziher (Heb. Myth.) with Milka
(Abram&rsquo;s sister-in-law), whom he supposes to have the same
meaning. It is remarkable, by the way, that the writer of the Epistle
to the Hebrews, in telling the story of Abram and Melchizedek minutely
and critically, omits the offering of bread and wine. This is not only
an indication that the Epistle was written as already said, before
Paul&rsquo;s institution of the eucharist (1 Cor. x., xi.), but
suggests that the writer may have suspected the offerings as pagan. The
Soma juice was sacred also in Persia, and is the H&ocirc;m of the
Avesta. Ewald says of the story in Gen. xiv., &ldquo;The whole
narrative looks like a fragment torn from a more general history of
Western Asia, merely on account of the mention of Abraham contained in
it.&rdquo; (<i>Hist. of Israel</i>, p. 308. London, 1867.) And finally
it may be noted that among the kings Abram smote, just before meeting
Melchizedek, was Chedorlaomer, King of Elam. Elam is south of Assyria
and east of Persia proper; if he fought Abram near Jerusalem,
Chedorlaomer was about one thousand miles from his kingdom, Elam.
Probably it was not he but a name and legend of his kingdom that
drifted into Jewish folklore.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Queen of Sheba certainly deserved her exaltation
as the Hebrew Athena, and the homage paid to her by Jesus, for
journeying so far simply to hear the wisdom of Solomon. In Jewish and
Christian folklore are many miraculous tales about the Queen&rsquo;s
visit, but in the Biblical records, in the books of &ldquo;Kings&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Chronicles,&rdquo; the only miracle is the entire absence of
anything marvellous, magical, or even occult. The Queen was impressed
by Solomon&rsquo;s science, wisdom, the edifices he had built, the
civilization he had brought about; they exchanged gifts, and she
departed. It is a strangely rational history to find in any ancient
annals.</p>
<p>The saying of Jesus cited by Clement of Alexandria, &ldquo;He that
hath marvelled shall reign,&rdquo; uttered perhaps with a sigh, tells
too faithfully how small has been the interest of grand people in the
wisdom that is &ldquo;clear, undefiled, plain.&rdquo; They are
represented rather by the beautiful and wealthy Marchioness in
&ldquo;Gil Blas,&rdquo; whose favour was sought by the nobleman, the
ecclesiastic, the philosopher, the dramatist, by all the brilliant
people, but who set them all aside for an ape-like hunchback, with whom
she passed many hours, to the wonder of all, until it was discovered
that the repulsive creature was instructing her ladyship in cabalistic
lore and magic. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165"
name="pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is much human pathos in this longing of mortals to attain to
some kind of real and intimate perception beyond the phenomenal
universe, and to some personal assurance of a future existence; but it
has cost much to the true wisdom of this world. Some realization of
this may have caused the sorrow of Jesus at Dalmanutha, as related in
Mark. &ldquo;The Pharisees came forth and began to question with him,
seeking of him a sign from heaven, testing him. And he sighed deeply in
his spirit, and saith, Why does this people seek a sign? I say plainly
unto you no sign will be given them. And he left them, and
re&euml;ntering the boat departed to the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They who now long to know the real mind of Jesus are often
constrained to repeat his deep sigh when they find the most probable
utterances ascribed to him perverted by the marvel-mongers, insomuch
that to the protest just quoted Matthew adds a self-contradictory
sentence about Jonah. That this unqualified repudiation by Jesus of
miracles should have been preserved at all in Mark, a gospel full of
miracles, is a guarantee of the genuineness of the incident, and of the
comparative earliness of some parts of that gospel. The period of
sophistication was not far advanced. Miracles require time to grow. But
the deep sigh and the words of Jesus, taken in connection with the
entire absence from the Epistles&mdash;the earliest New Testament
documents&mdash;of any hint of a miracle wrought by him, is sufficient
to bring us into the presence of a man totally different from the
&ldquo;Christ&rdquo; of the four Gospels.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3188src" href="#xd21e3188" name="xd21e3188src">1</a></p>
<p>Those who seek the real Jesus will find it the least part of their
task to clear away the particular miracles <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>ascribed to him; that is easy enough; the
critical and difficult thing is to detach from the anecdotes and
language connected with him every admixture derived from the belief in
his resurrection. To do this completely is indeed impossible.</p>
<p>Paul, probably a contemporary of Jesus, knew well enough the vast
difference between the man &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; and the risen
&ldquo;Christ&rdquo;; he insisted that the man should be ignored, and
supplanted by the risen Christ, as revealed by private revelations
received by himself after the resurrection. The student must now
reverse that: he must ignore those post-resurrectional revelations if
he would know Jesus &ldquo;after the flesh&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the
real Jesus.</p>
<p>In an age when immortality is a familiar religious belief we can
hardly realize the agitation, among a people to whom life after death
was a vague, imported philosophy, excited by the belief that a man had
been raised bodily from the grave. Immortality was no longer
hypothesis. If to this belief be added the further conviction that this
resurrection was preliminary to his speedy reappearance, and the
world&rsquo;s sudden transformation, a mental condition could not fail
to arise in which any ethical or philosophical ideas he might have
uttered while &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; must be thrown into the
background, as of merely casual or temporary importance. Such is the
state of mind reflected in the Pauline Epistles. In them is found no
reference whatever to any moral instructions by Jesus. And when after
some two generations had passed, and they who had expected while yet
living to meet their returning Lord had died, those who had heard oral
reports and legends concerning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167"
href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>him and his teachings began
to write the memoranda on which our Synoptical Gospels are based, it
was too late to give these without adulterations from the apostolic
ecstasy. His casual or playful remarks were by this time discoloured
and distorted, and enormously swollen, as if under a solar microscope,
by the overwhelming conceptions of a resurrection, an approaching
advent, a subversion of all nationalities and institutions.</p>
<p>The most serious complication arises from the extent to which the
pretended revelations of Paul have been built into the Gospels. The
so-called &ldquo;conversion of Paul&rdquo; was really the conversion of
Jesus. The facts can only be gathered from Paul&rsquo;s letters, the
book of &ldquo;Acts&rdquo; being hardly more historical than
&ldquo;Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo; The account in &ldquo;Acts&rdquo; of
Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; is, however, of interest as
indicating a purpose in its writers to raise Paul into a supernatural
authority equivalent to that ascribed to Christ, in order that he might
set aside the man Jesus. The story is a travesty of that related in the
&ldquo;Gospel According to the Hebrews,&rdquo; concerning the baptism
of Jesus: &ldquo;And a voice out of the heaven saying, &lsquo;Thou art
my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased&rsquo;: and again, &lsquo;I
have this day begotten thee.&rsquo; And straightway a great light shone
around the place. And when John saw it he saith to him, &lsquo;Who art
thou, Lord?&rsquo;&rdquo; John fell down before Jesus as did Paul
before Christ. &ldquo;At midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from
heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and
them that journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth,
I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, &lsquo;Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me? It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168"
href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>hard for thee to kick against
the goad.&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Who art thou, Lord?&rsquo;&rdquo;
(Precisely what John said to Jesus at the baptism.)</p>
<p>This story (Acts xxvi. 13&ndash;15), quite inconsistent with
Paul&rsquo;s letters, is throughout very ingenious. Besides associating
Paul with the supernatural consecration of Jesus, it replies, by
calling him Saul, to the Ebionite declaration that Paul had been a
pagan, who had become a Jewish proselyte with the intention of marrying
the High Priest&rsquo;s daughter. There is no reason to suppose that
Paul was ever called Saul during his life, and his salutation of two
kinsmen in Rome with Latin names, Andronicus and Junias (Romans xvi.
7), renders it probable that he was not entirely if at all Hebrew. The
sentence, &ldquo;It is hard for thee to kick against the goad,&rdquo;
is a subtle answer to any who might think it curious that the story of
the resurrection carried no conviction to Paul&rsquo;s mind at the time
of its occurrence by suggesting that in continuing his persecutions he
was going against his real belief&mdash;kicking against the goad.</p>
<p>Paul, however, knows nothing of this theatrical conversion in his
letters. But in severe competition with other &ldquo;pre&euml;minent
apostles,&rdquo; who were preaching &ldquo;another Christ&rdquo; from
his, he pronounces them accursed, supporting an authority above theirs
by declaring that he had repeated interviews with the risen Christ, and
on one occasion had been taken up into the third heaven and even into
Paradise! The extremes to which Paul was driven by the opposing
apostles are illustrated in his intimidation of dissenting converts by
his pretence to an occult power of withering up the flesh of those whom
he disapproves (1 Cor. v. 5). He tells Timothy of two men,
Hymen&oelig;us and Alexander, whom he thus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>&ldquo;delivered over to Satan&rdquo; that
&ldquo;they may be taught not to blaspheme&rdquo;&mdash;the blasphemy
in this case being the belief (now become orthodoxy) that the dead were
not sleeping in their graves but passed into heaven or hell at death.
In the book of &ldquo;Acts&rdquo; (xiii.) this claim of Paul&rsquo;s
seems to have been developed into the Evil Eye (which he fastened on
Bar Jesus, whose eyes thereon went out), and may perhaps account for
the similar sinister power ascribed to some of the Popes.</p>
<p>In this story of Bar Jesus, Christ is associated with Paul in
striking the learned man blind (xiii. 11), and the development of such
a legend reveals the extent to which Jesus had been converted by Paul.
In 1 Cor. ii. he presents a Christ whose body and blood, being not
precisely discriminated in the sacramental bread and wine, had made
some participants sickly and killed others, in addition to the
damnation they had eaten and drank. He does not mention that any who
communicated correctly had been physically benefited thereby; only the
malignant powers appear to have had any utility for Paul.</p>
<p>That this menacing Christ may have been needed to intimidate
converts and build up churches is probable; that such a being was
nothing like Jesus in the flesh, but had to come by pretended
posthumous revelation, as an awful potentate whose human flesh had been
but a disguise, is certain. We need not, therefore, be surprised to
find that nearly everything pharisaic, cruel, and ungentlemanly,
ascribed to Jesus in the synoptical Gospels, is fabricated out of
Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. Paul compares rival apostles to the serpent that
beguiled Eve (2 Cor. xi. 3, 4), and Christ calls his opponents
offspring of vipers. The fourth Gospel, apostolic in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>spirit, degrades Jesus independently, but it
also borrows from Paul. Paul personally delivered some over to Satan,
and the intimation in John xiii. 27, &ldquo;after the sop, then entered
Satan into Judas,&rdquo; accords well with what Paul says about the
unworthy communicant eating and drinking damnation (1 Cor. xi. 29).</p>
<p>The Eucharist itself was probably Paul&rsquo;s own adaptation of a
Mithraic rite to Christian purposes. There is no reason to suppose that
there was anything sanctimonious in the wine supper which Jesus took
with his friends at the time of the Passover, and Paul&rsquo;s
testimony concerning the way it had been observed is against any over
with you?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3220src" href="#xd21e3220"
name="xd21e3220src">2</a> Had it been other than a pleasant Epiphanius
from the Gospel according to the Hebrews show that he desired to draw
his friends away from the sacrificial feature of the festival:
&ldquo;Where wilt thou that we prepare for the passover to eat?&rdquo;
... &ldquo;Have I desired with desire to eat this flesh, the passover
with you?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3223src" href="#xd21e3223"
name="xd21e3223src">3</a> Had it been other than a pleasant wine supper
it could not in so short a time have become the jovial festival which
Paul describes (1 Cor. xi. 20), nor, in order to reform it, would he
have needed the pretence that he had received from Christ the special
revelation of details of the Supper which he gives, and which the
Gospels have followed. Having substituted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>a human for an animal
sacrifice (&ldquo;our passover also hath been sacrificed,
Christ,&rdquo; 1 Cor. v. 7), he restores precisely that sacrificial
feature to which Jesus had objected; and in harmony with this goes on
to show that human lives have been sacrificed to the majestic real
presence (1 Cor. xi. 30). He had learned, perhaps by
&ldquo;pagan&rdquo; experiences, what power such a sacrament might put
into the priestly hand.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3234src" href=
"#xd21e3234" name="xd21e3234src">4</a></p>
<p>It is Paul who first appointed Christ the judge of quick and dead (1
Tim. iv. 1). He describes to the Thessalonians (2 Thes. i.) &ldquo;the
revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power
in flaming fire, rendering vengeance to them that know not God,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;eternal destruction&rdquo; of these. Hence, &ldquo;I
never knew you&rdquo; becomes a formula of damnation put into the mouth
of Christ. &ldquo;I know you not&rdquo; is the brutal reply of the
bridegroom to the five virgins, whose lamps were not ready on the
moment of his arrival. The picturesque incidents of this parable have
caused its representation in pretty pictures, which blind many to its
essential heartlessness. It is curious that it should be preserved in a
Gospel which contains the words, &ldquo;Knock, and it shall be opened
unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh
findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.&rdquo; The
parable is fabricated out of 1 Thes. v., where Paul warns the converts
that the Lord cometh as a thief in the night, that there will be no
escape for those who then slumber, that they must not sleep like the
rest, but watch, &ldquo;for God hath appointed <i>us</i> not unto
wrath.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Christian dogma of the unpardonable sin, substituted for the
earlier idea of an unrepentable sin, was developed out of Paul&rsquo;s
fatalism. He writes, &ldquo;For this cause God sendeth them a strong
delusion that they should believe a lie&rdquo; (2 Thes. ii). Although
this is not connected in any Gospel with the inexpiable sin, we find
its spirit animating the Paul-created Christ in Mark iv. 11:
&ldquo;Unto them that are without all these things are done in
parables, that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they
may hear and not understand: lest at any time they should be converted,
and their sins should be forgiven them.&rdquo; This is imported from
Paul (Rom. xi. 7, 8): &ldquo;That which Israel seeketh for, that he
obtained not; but the elect obtained it and the rest were hardened;
according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that
they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whence came this Christ who, in the very chapter where Jesus warns
men against hiding their lamp under a bushel, carefully hides his
teaching under a parable for the express purpose of preventing some
outsiders from being enlightened and obtaining forgiveness?</p>
<p>Jesus could not have said these things unless he plagiarized from
Paul by anticipation. Deduct from the Gospels all that has been
fabricated out of Paul (I have given only the more salient examples)
and there will be found little or nothing morally revolting, nothing
heartless. Superstitions abound, but so far as Jesus is concerned they
are nearly all benevolent in their spirit.</p>
<p>But even after we have removed from the Gospels the immoralities of
Paul and the pharisaisms so profound as to suggest the proselyte, after
we have turned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>from his Christ to seek Jesus, we have yet to
divest him of the sombre vestments of a supernatural being, who could
not open his lips or perform any action but in relation to a
resurrection and a heavenly office of which he could never have
dreamed. Was he</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;The faultless monster whom the world
ne&rsquo;er saw&rdquo;?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Did he never laugh? Did he eat with sinners only to
call them to repentance? Did he get the name of wine-bibber for his
&ldquo;salvationism,&rdquo;&mdash;or was it because, like Omar
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3258" title=
"Source: Khayy&acirc;m">Khayy&aacute;m</span>, he defied the
sanctimonious and the puritanical by gathering with the intellectual,
the scholarly, the Solomonic clubs?</p>
<p>To Paul we owe one credible item concerning Jesus, that he was
originally wealthy (2 Cor. viii. 9), and as Paul mentioned this to
inculcate liberality in contributors, it is not necessary to suppose
that he alluded to his heavenly riches. At any rate, the few sayings
that may be reasonably ascribed to Jesus are those of an educated
gentleman, and strongly suggest his instruction in the college of
Hillel, whose spirit remained there after his death, which occurred
when Jesus was at least ten years old.</p>
<p>To a pagan who asked Hillel concerning the law, he answered:
&ldquo;That which you like not for yourself do not to thy neighbour,
that is the whole law; the rest is but commentary.&rdquo; It will be
observed that Hillel humanizes the law laid down in Lev. xix. 18, where
the Israelites are to love each his neighbour among &ldquo;the children
of thy people&rdquo; as himself. Even Paul (Rom. xiii. 8, Gal. v. 14)
quotes it for a rule among the believers, while hurling anathema on
others. But Jesus is made (Matt. vii. 12) to inflate the rule into the
impracticable form of &ldquo;All things whatsoever ye would that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto
them.&rdquo; By which rule a wealthy Christian would give at least half
his property to the first beggar, as he would wish the beggar to do to
him were their situations reversed. This might be natural enough in a
community hourly expecting the end of the world and their own
instalment in palaces whose splendour would be proportioned to their
poverty in this world. But when this delusion faded the rule reverted
to what Hillel said, and no doubt Jesus also, as we find it in the
second verse of &ldquo;<i>Didache</i>,&rdquo; the <i>Teaching of the
Twelve Apostles</i>. It is a principle laid down by Confucius, Buddha,
and all the human &ldquo;prophets,&rdquo; and one followed by every
gentleman, not to do to his neighbour what he would not like if done to
himself. But it is removed out of human ethics and strained <i>ad
absurdum</i> by the second-adventist version put into the mouth of
Jesus by Matthew. I have dwelt on this as an illustration of how
irrecoverably a man loses his manhood when he is made a God.</p>
<p>Irrecoverably! In the second Clementine Epistle (xii. 2) it is said,
&ldquo;For the Lord himself, having been asked by some one when his
kingdom should come, said, When the two shall be one, and the outside
as the inside, and the male with the female neither male nor
female.&rdquo; Perhaps a humorous way of saying <i>Never</i>. Equally
remote appears the prospect of recovering the man Jesus from his
Christ-sepulchre. Even among rationalists there are probably but few
who would not be scandalized by any thorough test such as Jesus is
said, in the Nazarene Gospel, to have requested of his disciples after
his resurrection, &ldquo;Take, feel me, and see that I am not a
bodiless demon!&rdquo; Without blood, without passion, he remains
without the experiences and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>faults that mould best men, as
Shakespeare tells us; he so remains in the nerves where no longer in
the intellect, insomuch that even many an agnostic would shudder if any
heretic, taking his life in his hand, should maintain that Jesus had
fallen in love, or was a married man, or had children. <span class=

1832 the Rev. Ralph Waldo Emerson notified his congregation in Boston
(Unitarian) that he could no longer administer the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s

course at South Place Chapel, London. The Boston congregation clung to
the sacrament, and gave up their minister to mankind. The London
congregation gave up the sacrament, and there was substituted for it
the famous South Place Banquet, which was attended by such men as Leigh
Hunt, Mill, Thomas Campbell, Jerrold, and such women as Harriet
Martineau, Eliza Flower, Sarah Flower Adams (who wrote &ldquo;Nearer,
My God, To Thee&rdquo;). The speeches and talk at this banquet were of
the highest character, and the festival was no doubt nearer in spirit
to the supper of Jesus and his friends than any sacrament.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Mythological Mantle of Solomon Fallen on
Jesus.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is no part of my aim to prove miracles impossible,
nor to consider whether one or another alleged wonder might not be
really within the powers of an exceptional man. In the absence of any
apostolic allusion to any extraordinary incident in the life of Jesus,
and his own declaration (for the evangelists could not have invented a
rebuke to their own narratives) that miracles were the vain expectation
of a people in distress and degradation, such records have lost their
historic character. As Gibbon said in the last century, it requires a
miracle of grace to make a believer in miracles, and even among the
uncritical that miracle is not frequent. In the New Testament belief in
miracle has its natural corollary in a miraculous morality,&mdash;a
dissolution of earthly ties, a severance from worldly affairs, a
non-resistance and passiveness under wrongs, which are in perfect
accord with persons moving in an apocalyptic dream, but not with a
world awakened from that dream.</p>
<p>But at the root of the unnatural miracles is the natural
miracle&mdash;the heart of man. We are such stuff as dreams are made
on, as the miracle-working poet reminds us; our little life is
surrounded with a sleep, a realm of dreams,&mdash;visions that give
poetic fulfilment to hopes born of hard experience. No biblical miracle
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>its literal form is so beautiful and impressive
as the history of its origin and development as traced by the student
of mythology. The growth, for example, of a simple proverb ascribed to
Solomon &ldquo;He that trusteth in his riches shall fall, but the just
shall flourish as a green leaf&rdquo; into a hymn (Ps. lii.); the
association of this Psalm, by its Hebrew caption, with hungry David
eating the shewbread of the temple, and the king&rsquo;s slaying the
priests who permitted it; the use of this legend by Jesus when his
disciples were censured for plucking the corn on the Sabbath (with
perhaps some humorous picture of a great king in Heaven angry because
hungry men ate a few grains of corn, crumbs from his royal table)
pointed with advice that the censors should learn that God desires
charity and not sacrifice; the development of this into an early
Christian burden against the rich, which took the form of an old
Oriental fable,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3297src" href="#xd21e3297"
name="xd21e3297src">1</a> to which a Jewish connotation was given by
giving the poor man in Paradise the name of Lazarus (i.e. Eleazar, who
risked his life to obtain water for famished David, a story that may
have been referred to by Jesus along with that of the shewbread); the
transformation of this parable into a quasi-historical narrative
representing the return of Lazarus from Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, his
poverty omitted; the European combination of the parable and the
history by creating a St. Lazarus (&ldquo;one helped by God&rdquo;),
yet appointing him the helper of beggars (<i lang="it">lazzaroni</i>):
these items together represent a continuity of the human spirit through
thousands of years, surmounting obstructive superstitions, holding
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>still the guiding thread of humanity through
long labyrinths of legend.</p>
<p>To fix on any one stage in such an evolution, detach it, affirm it,
is to wrest a true scripture to its destruction. Few can really be
interested in Abimelech and the shewbread; no one now believes that a
rich man must go to hell because he is rich, nor a pauper to Paradise
because of his pauperism; and none can intelligently believe the
narrative of the resurrection of Lazarus without believing that in
Jesus miraculous power was associated with the unveracity and vanity
ascribed to him in that narrative. But take the legends all together,
and in them is visible the supersacred heart of humanity steadily
developing through manifold symbols and fables the religion of human
helpfulness and happiness. The study of mythology is the study of
nature.</p>
<p>The theory already stated (<i>ante</i> I), that illegitimacy or
irregularity of birth was a sign of authentication for &ldquo;the
God-anointed,&rdquo; finds some corroboration in the claim of the
Epistle to the Hebrews that Jesus, like Melchizedek, was without
father, mother, or genealogy. His double nature is suggested:
&ldquo;Our Lord sprung out of Judah&rdquo; (vii. 14), yet (verse 16),
as priest, he has arisen &ldquo;not after the law of a carnal
commandment, but after the power of an indissoluble life.&rdquo; The
writer admits that what he writes about Melchizedek is &ldquo;hard of
interpretation,&rdquo; and perhaps it so proved to the genealogist
(Matt, i.) who apparently was animated by a desire to make out a
carnal-law inheritance of the throne, yet not so legitimate as to
exclude divine interference at various stages. In the forty-two
generations only five mothers are named,&mdash;all associated either
with sexual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>immorality or some kind of irregularity in their
matrimonial relations. Tamar, through whose adultery with her
father-in-law, Judah, his almost extinct line was preserved, is already
a holy woman in the book of Ruth (iv. 12), and the association there of
Ruth&rsquo;s name with this particular one of the many female ancestors
of her son, and her mention in Matthew, look as if some editor of Ruth
as well as the genealogist desired to cast suspicion on her midnight
visit to Boaz. &ldquo;The Lord gave Tamar conception, and she bore a
son&rdquo;&mdash;grandfather of David. It is also doubtful whether
Rahab, who comes next to Tamar in Matthew&rsquo;s list, is called a
harlot in the book of Joshua: <i>Zuneh</i> is said to mean
&ldquo;hostess&rdquo; or &ldquo;tavern-keeper.&rdquo; But in the
Epistle to the Hebrews and in that of James she becomes a glorified
harlot. The next female ancestor of Jesus mentioned is &ldquo;her of
Uriah.&rdquo; The name of the woman is not given,&mdash;the important
fact being apparently that she was somebody&rsquo;s wife. Our
translators have supplied no fewer than five words to save this text
from signifying that Bathsheba was still Uriah&rsquo;s wife when
Solomon was born.</p>
<p>The next ancestress named after the mother of Solomon is the mother
of Jesus, Mary, in whom Bathsheba finds transfiguration. The exaltation
of the adulterous mother of Solomon has already been referred to (ante
II.), and the traditional ascription to her of the authorship of the
last chapter of Proverbs. She was also supposed to be the original or
model of &ldquo;the Virtuous Woman&rdquo; therein portrayed! Now, in
that same chapter she is pronounced &ldquo;blessed,&rdquo; and
excelling all the daughters who have done virtuously (Cf. Luke i. 28,
42). In the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; (ix. 5) a phrase is used by
Solomon which is also used by his mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>(Bathsheba) when she
conjured from David the decree for his succession,&mdash;&ldquo;thine
handmaiden&rdquo; (1 Kings i.). Solomon says, &ldquo;For I, thy
servant, and son of thy handmaiden,&rdquo; etc. This was written in a
popular work about the time of the birth of Jesus. We find the
&ldquo;blessed&rdquo; of Proverbs xxxi. 28, and the
&ldquo;handmaiden&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; both in
Mary&rsquo;s <i>magnificat</i>: &ldquo;For he hath regarded the low
estate of his handmaiden; for behold, from henceforth all generations
shall call me blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Ecclesiasticus (xv. 2) we find the enigmatic clause concerning
Solomonic &ldquo;Sophia,&rdquo; personified Wisdom: <span class="trans"

<p>(The words in crochets are added by the LXX.)</p>
<p>The clause in Ecclus. xv. 2, taken with the chapter it continues,
conveys to me an impression of rhapsodical paradox, as when Dante
apostrophises Mary: &ldquo;O Virgin <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>Mother, daughter of
thy son!&rdquo; The Semitic goddess is born, Wisdom, sister of virginal
Athena of the Parthenon, yet fulfilling the Solomonic exaltation of the
Virtuous Woman, who is also a wife. She is therefore the Virgin
Bride.</p>
<p>But whether this interpretation is correct or not, it cannot be
doubted that this strange phrase in a household book might easily
convey that impression, and that to believers in the resurrection of
Jesus the feeling that he must also have entered the world in a
supernatural way might naturally have associated Miriam his mother with
the virgin bride, Wisdom.</p>
<p>The evolution of Wisdom into the Holy Spirit has been traced
(<i>ante</i> XII.), and it is sufficient to mention here that in the
&ldquo;Gospel according to the Hebrews,&rdquo; Jesus uses the phrase
&ldquo;My mother the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; the resurrected Solomon says,
&ldquo;I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and that with cares&rdquo;
(vii. 4, cf. Luke ii. 7). This might be said of every babe, but the
King, having begun by saying &ldquo;I myself also am a mortal
man,&rdquo; mentions the swaddling clothes as a sign of lowliness; and
the impression made by this item in the Birth-legend of Jesus is shown
by a passage in the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy. It is said that when
the Wise Men came, in obedience to a prophecy of Zoroaster, Mary
rewarded their gifts with one of the child&rsquo;s &ldquo;Swaddling
bands,&rdquo; which on their return to their own land withstood the
power of fire, in which it was tested.</p>
<p>The infant Jesus receives gifts of the Wise Men, traceable to the
gold, silver, and spices brought by the Queen of Sheba (afterwards
&ldquo;Sophia&rdquo;) to Solomon. (Cf. also Psalm lxxii. 8&ndash;11.)
As Solomon to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182"
name="pb182">182</a>]</span>Queen, so Jesus gives proofs of astounding
wisdom to the woman of Samaria.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; the returned king proceeds:
&ldquo;I was a witty child, and had a good spirit. Yea rather, being
good, I came into a body undefiled&rdquo; (viii. 19, 20). In Luke it is
said, &ldquo;And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled
with wisdom.&rdquo; &ldquo;And Jesus increased in wisdom and
stature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;undefiled&rdquo; was a special title of Wisdom. In
the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; (vii.) the King, having described
his birth, &ldquo;like to all,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;swaddling
clothes,&rdquo; follows this immediately by saying, &ldquo;I prayed,
and understanding was given me; I called, and the spirit of Wisdom came
to me.&rdquo; This is the new and the spiritual birth. Among the titles
ascribed in the same chapter to Wisdom is &ldquo;Undefiled,&rdquo; this
being emphasized three verses lower by the declaration that being a
pure emanation from God &ldquo;no defiled thing can fall into
her.&rdquo; These ideas, so far as Solomon is concerned, are referable
to his prayer for wisdom (1 Kings iii. 9) and to Jahveh&rsquo;s
adoption of him (Psalm ii. 7). &ldquo;Thou art my son, this day have I
begotten thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These ideas all reappear at the baptism of Jesus, as related in the
&ldquo;Gospel according to Hebrews&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Behold the mother of the Lord and his brethren
said to him, &lsquo;John the Baptist baptizeth for remission of sins:
let us go and be baptized by him.&rsquo; But he said to them,
&lsquo;Wherein have I sinned that I should go and be baptized by him?
except perchance this very thing that I have said is ignorance.&rsquo;
And when the people had been baptized Jesus also came and was baptized
by John. And as he went up the heavens were opened, and he saw the Holy
Spirit in shape of a Dove descending and entering him. And a voice out
of heaven, saying, &lsquo;Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well
pleased&rsquo;; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183"
name="pb183">183</a>]</span>again, &lsquo;I have this day begotten
thee.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Cf. Jahveh&rsquo;s promise concerning Solomon, 1
Chron. xvii. 13, &ldquo;I will be his father and he shall be my
son.&rdquo;)</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to recall that this all occurred <i>before</i>
baptism. The suggestion that he should be baptized for remission of
sins, is met by Jesus as a challenge of his sinlessness. It is
submitted to the test, and before he enters the water the
&ldquo;Undefiled&rdquo; (the dove) enters him, and the deity announces
him as then and there begotten. When &ldquo;straightway a great light
shone around the place&rdquo;&mdash;ultimately the Star of Bethlehem.
John the Baptist is here the shepherd: seeing the light, he asks,
&ldquo;Who art thou, Lord?&rdquo; The heavenly voice replies,
&ldquo;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo; Then
John fell down before him and said, &ldquo;I pray thee, Lord, baptize
thou me.&rdquo; But he prevented him, saying, &ldquo;Let be; for thus
it is becoming that all things should be fulfilled.&rdquo; Then follows
the baptism, and the account continues:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And it came to pass, when the Lord had come up
from the water, the entire fountain of the Holy Spirit descended and
rested upon him and said to him, &lsquo;My Son, in all the prophets did
I await thee, that thou mightest come and I might rest in thee; for
thou art my rest; thou art my first-born Son that reignest
forever.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3418src" href=
"#xd21e3418" name="xd21e3418src">2</a></p>
</div>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;entire fountain of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; is
Pars&icirc;. An&acirc;hita is the Holy Spirit; her influence is always
described as a fountain descending on the saints or heroes to whom she
gives strength. It will be remembered that in this Gospel the Holy
Spirit is also feminine. The use of the words &ldquo;fountain&rdquo;
and &ldquo;rest in thee&rdquo; are interesting in connection with the
account of John the Baptizer and Jesus in the fourth gospel,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>which differs so widely from the Synoptical
narratives. It is in John (iii.) left doubtful whether Jesus accepted
any baptismal rite at all. John was baptizing at a large pool called
&AElig;non-by-Saleim,&mdash;probably allegorical, meaning
&ldquo;Fountain of Repose.&rdquo; Jesus and his friends came there and
plunged in (<span class="trans" title="ebaptixonto"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"el">&#7952;&beta;&alpha;&pi;&tau;&#8055;&xi;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&omicron;</span></span>),
but they seem to have been a distinct party from that of John.</p>
<p>After the supposed resurrection of Jesus everything he did, even
taking a bath, became mystical. Jerome says that in his time there was
a place called Salumias, and he maintained that it was there that
Melchizedek refreshed Abraham. There are various readings of this
Saleim in the New Testament, all, no doubt, variants of Solomon, all
meaning &ldquo;rest&rdquo;; and the fourth Gospel supplies in
&lsquo;<span class="trans" title=
"Ain&#333;n engys Sal&#275;m"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Alpha;&#8054;&nu;&#8182;&nu;
&#7952;&gamma;&gamma;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&Sigma;&alpha;&lambda;&eta;&mu;</span></span>&rsquo; the basis of the
legend in the Aramaic Gospel of the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; which the Holy
Spirit found in her son, on whom her &ldquo;entire fountain&rdquo; was
poured. And with this legend may also be read the words of
&ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon,&rdquo; vii. 27, 28: &ldquo;She (Wisdom)
maketh all things new; and in all ages entering into holy souls she
maketh them friends of God and prophets. For God loveth none but him
that dwelleth with Wisdom.&rdquo; The representation in this Aramaic
Gospel of the Holy Spirit as &ldquo;entering into&rdquo; Jesus is
especially interesting in connection with the use of the same phrase in
&ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon,&rdquo;&mdash;into whose heart Wisdom was put
by God (1 Kings x. 24).</p>
<p>It is only after Wisdom has entered into Jesus that the voice is
heard, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.&rdquo;
This accords with Solomon&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;God loveth none but him
that dwelleth with Wisdom.&rdquo; The angelic song at the birth (Luke
ii. 14) preserves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185"
name="pb185">185</a>]</span>the heavenly voice at the baptism
concerning &ldquo;peace.&rdquo; The &ldquo;peace&rdquo; is
Solomon&rsquo;s own name, associated with the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; given
to his reign in order that he might build the temple (1 Kings v. 4,
Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 13). &ldquo;My Son,&rdquo; says the spirit from
within Jesus, &ldquo;Thou art my rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the title pre&euml;minently belonging to
Solomon, &ldquo;Prince of Peace,&rdquo; and unknown to the Gospels as a
title of Jesus, should be traditionally given to one said to have
declared that he had come on earth to bring not peace but a sword, and
bids his disciples arm themselves. No doubt the religious instinct
tells true in this; it is tolerably plain that the warlike words were
ascribed to Jesus not because he said them, but to adapt him to the
&ldquo;Word&rdquo; as described in the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo;:
&ldquo;While all things were in quiet silence ... thine Almighty Word
leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne as a fierce man of war
... and brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword,&rdquo;
etc. The fierce metaphor was, as we have seen, caught up and
spiritualized in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and passed on to be
literalized for the risen Christ, so that the consecration of the sword
by the Prince of Peace is writ large in the Christian wars of many
centuries.</p>
<p>To the tests and proofs of Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom recorded in 1
Kings iii. and x. many additions were made by rabbinical tradition,
mostly derived from Pars&icirc; scriptures. The famous Ring of Solomon
is the symbol of sovereignty over the part of the earth owned by God
given by him to the first man King Yima&mdash;&ldquo;Then I, Ahura
Mazda, brought two implements unto him, a golden ring and a poniard
inlaid with gold. Behold, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>here Yima bears the royal
sway!&rdquo; (Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d, Farg. ii. 5). When Yima pressed the
earth with this ring, the genius of the Earth, Arama&icirc;ti,
responded to his wish and order. The ring represented Yima&rsquo;s
&ldquo;glory&rdquo; (in Avestan phrase), his divine potency, lost when
he yielded to a temptation of the devil, and Solomon also lost his ring
with which, as we have seen (<i>ante</i> IV.) his &ldquo;glory&rdquo;
and royal sway passed to the (Persian) devil Asmodeus. This occurred in
a trial of wits, Asmodeus propounding hard questions, which Solomon was
able to answer until, proudly thinking he could answer by his unaided
intellect, he laid aside his ring, at the challenge of Asmodeus. These
hard questions are found in an ancient legend of a similar contest
between the devil and Zoroaster, and are alluded to as &ldquo;malignant
riddles.&rdquo; Zoroaster met the devil &ldquo;unshaken by the hardness
of his malignant riddles,&rdquo; and swinging &ldquo;stones as big as a
house,&rdquo; which he had obtained from the Maker,&mdash;tables of the
divine law, and possibly origin of the stones which the devil
challenged Jesus to turn into bread.</p>
<p>There are Avestan elements in the legend of the temptation of Jesus
that do not appear in the legends of Solomon. In Pars&icirc; belief the
land of demons on earth is M&acirc;zana. From that region they issue to
inflict diseases, especially blindness and deafness. In that region is
an &ldquo;exceeding high mountain,&rdquo; Dam&acirc;vand, to which the
great demon Azi Dah&acirc;ka was bound by Feridun who overcame him.
This demon was called &ldquo;the murderer,&rdquo;&mdash;the epithet
mysteriously applied by Jesus to the devil (John viii. 44). After
tempting and supplanting King Yima he ruled over the world for a
millennium in great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187"
name="pb187">187</a>]</span>splendour, and the chief of devils tempts
Zoroaster with that glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renounce the good law of the worshippers of Mazda, and thou
shalt gain such a boon as the Murderer gained, the ruler of
nations.&rdquo; Thus in answer to him said Zoroaster, &ldquo;No, never
will I renounce the good law of the worshippers of Mazda, though my
body, my life, my soul, should burst.&rdquo; Again said the guileful
one, the Maker of the evil world, &ldquo;By whose word wilt thou
strike, by whose word wilt thou repel, by whose weapon will the good
creatures (strike and repel) my creation?&rdquo; Thus, in answer, said
Zoroaster, &ldquo;The sacred mortar, the sacred cup, the Haoma [the
sacramental juice] the Words taught by Mazda, these are my
weapons.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3466src" href="#xd21e3466"
name="xd21e3466src">3</a></p>
<p>After this, Zoroaster &ldquo;on the mountain&rdquo; conversed with
Ahura Mazda, and invoked the beneficent beings who preside over the
seven Karshvares of the earth. We thus have here the mountain, the
stones, the Word from the mouth of God, the offer of the kingdoms of
the world, and the ministering angels, which reappear in the temptation
of Jesus.</p>
<p>After his baptism, Jesus repudiates his human parentage (&ldquo;who
is my mother?&rdquo; etc.), and was led up by his new mother&mdash;the
Spirit&mdash;into the wilderness to be tested by the devil. To this no
doubt relate the words of Jesus preserved by Origen from the
&ldquo;Gospel according to the Hebrews&rdquo;: &ldquo;Just now my
mother the Holy Spirit took me by one of my hairs and bore me up on the
great mountain Tabor.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3475src" href=
"#xd21e3475" name="xd21e3475src">4</a> Here the Solomonic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>kingdom and glory were offered by the devil if
Jesus would worship him. According to Luke iv. he was tempted forty
days (the number of the years of Solomon&rsquo;s reign). The first
incident thereafter was his announcement that the Spirit of the Lord
was upon him, and the second was an exhibition of his Solomonic power
over devils. This, in Luke, is his first miracle. His first titular
recognition was this surrender of the devil, who cried, &ldquo;I know
thee who them art, the Holy One of Israel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Matthew also the devils first give him the divine title
&ldquo;Son of God&rdquo; (vii. 29). In the next chapter he gives his
twelve disciples authority over demons. That this was well understood
by the people is shown in Matthew xii. 23, where, on seeing demons
mastered, they cry, &ldquo;Is this the Son of David?&rdquo; that is, is
this Solomon, the famous enslaver of demons?</p>
<p>It may be noted in passing that in the three miracles in Matthew of
exorcising a blinding demon the title &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo; is
used. Alford speaks of this as remarkable; but vision is the especial
promise of Wisdom, therefore of Solomon, son of David.</p>
<p>It may be remembered in this connection that in &ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo;
(Ecclus. iv.) the trial by Wisdom is set forth:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Whoso giveth ear unto her shall judge the
nations. * * * If a man commit himself unto her, he shall inherit her.
* * * At the first she will walk with him by crooked ways and bring
fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her discipline, until she
may trust his soul, and try him by her laws. Then she will return the
straight way unto him, and comfort him, and shew him her secrets. But
if he go wrong she will forsake him, and give him over to his own
ruin.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>This, which reappears in the parable of the broad and the narrow
ways, seems to have determined the part which the Holy Spirit performs
in the temptation of Jesus. According to Matthew he was by the Spirit
carried involuntarily, &ldquo;driven,&rdquo; says Mark, the Hebrew
Gospel says, &ldquo;borne by the hair&rdquo; into the wilderness: as
Jahveh &ldquo;raised a Satan unto Solomon,&rdquo; and left Job to
Satan, the Holy Spirit carries Jesus to Satan, the same Evil One; and
after his triumph the promise in &ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; (she will
&ldquo;comfort him&rdquo;) is fulfilled: &ldquo;Angels came and
ministered unto him.&rdquo; Luke says he &ldquo;returned in the power
of the Spirit into Galilee; and a fame went out concerning him through
all the region round about: he taught in their synagogues and was
glorified of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless it may be remarked that the peculiar language in Luke
(iv. 1) &ldquo;led in the spirit&rdquo; suggests that the whole story
is a late literalization of some vision, partly based on v. 7 of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, but originally on Solomon&rsquo;s dream (1
Kings iii.), in which Jahveh offers him any gift, and he asks only for
Wisdom. Or, as he (Solomon) says in &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon,&rdquo;
&ldquo;I preferred her before sceptres and thrones&rdquo; (vii. 8). But
all of these were remotely influenced by the trial of Zoroaster, and
the attempts of the devil to terrify Zoroaster before tempting him may
be hinted in Mark i. 13, &ldquo;He was with the wild beasts.&rdquo;
These, however, are more prominent in the temptation of Buddha.</p>
<p>Paul appears to have considered it an important apostolic credential
to have had to contend with a Satan (2 Cor. xii. 7&ndash;10), and Peter
was honoured by a special <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=
"#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>request made by Satan, and
conceded, that he should be for a time under his diabolical control.
(Luke xxii. 31.)</p>
<p>As in the case of Solomon, the tests and trials of the superhuman
wisdom and power of Jesus are found chiefly in tradition and folklore.
The apocryphal gospels contain many, and some are preserved by Persian
and Arabian poets. In the New Testament a few examples appear in which
his utterances are given a quasi-judicial tone. There are several
points of resemblance between the famous judgment of Solomon on the two
harlots contending for the child, and the sentence of Jesus in favour
of &ldquo;sinful Mary,&rdquo; sister of Martha, accused by Simon the
Pharisee. In both cases the decision was made at a feast, and in favour
of the one who &ldquo;loved much.&rdquo; It is not, however, the
incident in itself that is now referred to, but only the formality
ascribed to it in the narrative. And this adheres to the entire story.
The anointing of Jesus may have occurred, but the scenic touches recall
lines in the Solomonic &ldquo;Song of Songs&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;While the King sat at his table,</p>
<p class="line">My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is not impossible, by the way, that it was from
chaste Shulamith of the Song ascribed to Solomon that a bad reputation
was fixed on Mary Magdalene, against whose virginal purity no word is
said in the Bible, the chapter heading to Luke vii. alone identifying
her, in contradiction to John xi. 2, as the woman who anointed Jesus.
This libel seems to come from a far antiquity,&mdash;as far probably as
the Talmudic &ldquo;Miriam Magdala&rdquo; (i. e., Braided-hair Mary);
and this epithet might have been derived from Shulamith&rsquo;s
&ldquo;ringlets&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>which were &ldquo;tied up in
folds,&rdquo; and whose spikenard sent forth its odours while Solomon
was at the table. The later Jahvism must have considered such attention
by ladies to their hair as an evidence of wickedness. Paul, while
recognizing that long hair is a woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;glory&rdquo; (1
Cor. xi.) dangerously fascinating even to the angels, testifies against
&ldquo;braided hair&rdquo; (1 Tim. ii.), an instruction repeated in 1
Peter iii. Whether this lady of means who helped to support Jesus was
from Magdala or not, it is nearly certain that her legend was derived
from another sense of &ldquo;Magdalene,&rdquo; and it is not improbable
that the friendship of Jesus for her was in keeping with his Solomonic
defiance of the Pharisaic.</p>
<p>The Eastern tales of monarchs in disguise, derived from a legend of
Solomon, may have prepared the popular mind for the double r&ocirc;le
performed by Jesus in the Gospels, for the earlier writers do not
suggest any lowliness in his position beyond the humiliation of taking
on human flesh and dying. In the Gospels we find him now an hungered,
now dining with the Pharisee and anointed with precious ointment, again
multiplying food; an humble-son of man who has not where to lay his
head, a son of God with legions of angels at his command; purifying the
temple with violence, and predicting its destruction; a peacemaker
bringing a sword; telling his disciples to resist not evil, and arming
them; enjoining secrecy about his miracles, presently parading them;
prostrate with anguish in a garden, presently shining with unmasked
splendour. Solomon never arrayed himself in any such brilliant raiment
as that of the transfiguration, nor was his environment finer than the
scenes imaged in some of these parables,&mdash;the prodigal&rsquo;s
ring and robe, the king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href=
"#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>going to war and sending his
ambassadors, the masters of fields and vineyards, the momentous wedding
dress, the importance of rank and precedence at a feast. In miracles,
too, we have the grand wedding at Cana, and the homage of the centurion
deferentially rewarded<span class="corr" id="xd21e3515" title=
"Not in source">.</span><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3517src" href=
"#xd21e3517" name="xd21e3517src">5</a></p>
<p>In the Hebrew Gospel Jesus says, &ldquo;I will that ye be twelve
apostles for a testimony to Israel&rdquo;; with which we may compare
the &ldquo;twelve officers over all Israel&rdquo; appointed by Solomon
(1 Kings iv. 7). In Mark the first bestowal on Jesus of his Solomonic
title &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo; (x.) is immediately followed by his
Solomonic entry into Jerusalem. In Matthew the blind man&rsquo;s
tribute is followed by the cry of multitudes, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son
of David&rdquo;; and the whole scene is obviously from the narrative in
1 Kings i. of the procession of Solomon, seated on David&rsquo;s mule,
on the occasion of the anointing which made him the model Messiah, in
virtue of which he was King and Priest in combination. Solomon
dedicated the temple himself, as High Priest, and to him, as
King-Priest, the privilege of sanctuary was subordinate. Wherefore he
had an offender executed while holding the horns of the altar. The
titular Son of David, on the morrow of his triumphal entry, assumes
authority in the temple, and scourges out of it the sellers of things
used in the sacrifices,&mdash;especially Doves. These his human mother
had sacrificed after his birth for purification, but by this time they
symbolized his divine mother, the Holy Spirit, and were not to be
sold.</p>
<p>Who can suppose that this violence, which were as if one assaulted
those who sell holy candles and pictures in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>a
church vestibule, really occurred? At Oberammergau the whole tragedy of
the Passion Play hinges on the resentment of these merchants, who
appeal to the Sanhedrim for protection from the violence of one man
armed with a whip! The story (John ii.) is an epitaph of the primitive
Christ, the value of whose blood was its proof that his victory over
the Adversary was that of a Man, unaided by a divine, unblemished by a
carnal, weapon: triumph by either would have been defeat.</p>
<p>The bread and wine offered to Abraham by the mythical king-priest of
Salem (Solomon disguised as Melchizedek) may have been suggested by the
bread and wine offered by Wisdom to her guests, in Proverbs ix. However
this may be, there is clearly discoverable at the Last Supper of Jesus
the Satan that Jahveh raised up against Solomon in the presence of
mythical Judas (&ldquo;Satan entered into him,&rdquo; says John), and
in the whole scene the table of Wisdom. &ldquo;She hath mingled her
wine, she hath furnished her table,&rdquo; and cries&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Come, eat ye of my bread,</p>
<p class="line">And drink of the wine which I have mingled.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">That Jesus supped with his disciples, at the Passover
time, is very probable, but that the bread and wine alone should have
been selected for symbolical usage (a point unknown to the fourth
gospel) conforms too closely with the Solomonic prologue to be a mere
coincidence. The words &ldquo;Take, eat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Drink ye all of
it,&rdquo; recall also the Song of Songs&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Eat, O friends!</p>

<h2 class="main">The Heir of Solomon&rsquo;s Godhead.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The anger of Jahveh against Solomon (1 Kings xi.) is,
of course, the outcome of late theological explanations of how the
ancient and much idealised kingdom could have been divided after divine
promises of its protection. The interview with Solomon is a sort of
dramatization, in which the anachronism of making Jahveh a historic
contemporary of the Wise King represents the fact that when the tribal
deity was evolved it was in antagonism to a Solomon who, though his
body had long mouldered, was still &ldquo;marching on.&rdquo; That
Solomon had to contend with the hard and fanatical elements afterwards
consolidated in Jahvism is pretty clear, and we may see in him a
primitive Akbar. A century after Akbar&rsquo;s death the Rajah of
Joudpoor said to the emperor Aurungzebe: &ldquo;Your ancestor Akbar,
whose throne is now in heaven, conducted the affairs of his empire in
equity and security for the period of fifty years. He preserved every
tribe of men in repose and happiness, whether they were followers of
Jesus or of Moses, of Brahma or Mohammed. Of whatever sect or creed
they might be, they all equally enjoyed his countenance and favour,
insomuch that his people, in gratitude for the indiscriminate
protection which he afforded them, distinguished him by the appellation
of The Guardian of Mankind.&rdquo; Moslem fanaticism could not tolerate
such toleration, and Akbar&rsquo;s reign <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>was followed by
conflicts very similar to those which followed Solomon&rsquo;s reign,
leading to the Mogul empire, but ultimately to the reign of an
&ldquo;Empress of India,&rdquo; under whom we now see the same
toleration of all religions which prevailed in the fifty years of
Akbar.</p>
<p>The Moslem saw in Akbar&rsquo;s liberality and toleration the
supreme offence of putting other gods&mdash;Jesus, Brahma,
Ahuramazda&mdash;beside Allah. The Jahvist saw retrospectively in
Solomon&rsquo;s liberality the putting of Moloch, Ashera, and other
gods beside Jahveh. It was therefore recorded that Jahveh determined to
rend all the tribes save one from Solomon&rsquo;s son (a <i>vaticinium
ex evento</i>). But that one was enough to preserve the Solomon
cult.</p>

&mu;&#8049;&chi;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&iota;</span></span>. This
Necessity, which the Greeks saw working above all the gods, is man
himself, and worked also above Jah and Jahvism, nay, by means of them.
Gradually they seemed to prevail over Solomonism. The Proverbs and
Solomonic Psalms were transfused with Jahvism, but by this process the
heavenly and the terrestrial kings were confused, and the idea of a
human heir to the throne of Jahveh was conceived. As when, in our own
era, Islam swallowed Zoroaster, with the result of bringing forth the
great literary age of Persia, with Parsaism rationalized under a
transparent veil of Moslem phrase and fable, so anciently arose the
Hebrew Faizis and Saadis and Omar Khayy&aacute;ms. Of these was the
Isaiah who, with pigments of the Solomonic sunset, painted the sunrise
of a new day, and a new earth-born God.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
given, and the government shall rest on his shoulder; and his name
shall be called Counsellor of Wonders, God-hero, Father of Spoil,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>Prince of Peace. Enlarged shall be dominion, and
without cessation of peace, on the throne of David, and throughout his
kingdom, to establish it and uphold it by justice and righteousness
from henceforth and forever.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Every title, every tint, in this gorgeous vision is taken from the
nuptial song for Solomon (Ps. xlv.) and Solomon&rsquo;s Psalm (lxxii.)
The &ldquo;delightsomeness poured over (Solomon&rsquo;s) lips&rdquo;
(Ps. xlv. 2) makes the Counsellor of Wonders; his deification (verses
6, 7) makes the God-hero; the tributes of Tarshish, and Sheba make him
father of spoil (Ps. lxxii.); his &ldquo;mildness&rdquo; (Ps. xlv. 4)
his abundant &ldquo;peace&rdquo; (Ps. lxxii. 3, 7) make the Prince of
Peace; and the rest is a general refrain for both of the Psalms.</p>
<p>Psalm xlv. opens with the words, &ldquo;My verse concerns the
King,&rdquo; and there is a fair consensus of the learned that the king
is Solomon. It has been found impossible to fix upon any other monarch
to whom the eulogia would be applicable, and the resemblance of the
theme to the Song of Solomon proves that at an early period writers
connected the Psalm with Solomon and one of his espousals.</p>
<p>In quoting Professor Newman&rsquo;s translation of this Psalm
(<i>ante</i> II) I alluded to my slight alterations. These are few and
verbal, but momentous, and were not made without consultation of many
critical authorities and versions. Professor Newman was unable to
believe that the poet really meant to address Solomon as God, and in
verse 6 translates &ldquo;Thy throne divine,&rdquo; in verse 7,
&ldquo;Therefore hath God, thy God, etc.&rdquo; Others, with similar
theistic bias, have shrunk from what, according to the balance of
critical interpretation, is the clear sense of the original:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Thy throne, O God, ever and always
stands;</p>
<p class="line">A righteous sceptre is thy royal sceptre:</p>
<p class="line">Thou lovest right and hatest evil;</p>
<p class="line">Therefore, O God, hath thy God anointed thee</p>
<p class="line">With oil of joy above thy fellow-kings.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When these verses were written&mdash;and verse 11,
where after Adonai the Vulgate has Elohim, &ldquo;He is thy Lord God,
worship thou him&rdquo;&mdash;the rigid Jewish monotheism did not
exist; and the apostrophe might have continued without special notice
had not the psalm been included in the Jewish hymnology and thus given
the solemnity and consecration ascribed by Jahvism to its canonical
Book of Psalms. But ultimately it made a tremendous and even
revolutionary impression; and that the verses were interpreted as
bestowing the divine name on Solomon, by those most jealous of that
name, is proved, I think, by the following considerations:</p>
<p>1. Isaiah, in his vision quoted above (Is. ix.) combines the
phraseology of Ps. xlv. with that of Ps. lxxii. (which bears
Solomon&rsquo;s name as its author), and ascribes to a new-born child
the title &ldquo;God-hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. The recently discovered original of a fragment of Ecclesiasticus
includes the passage about Solomon in xlvii., and it is said in verse
18: &ldquo;Thou (Solomon) wast called by the glorious name which is
called over Israel.&rdquo; This seems to be a plain reference to the
ascriptions in Ps. xlv., where alone the divine name is applied to any
individual mortal. Ecclesiasticus was compiled early in the second
century before our era, and on the basis of much earlier compilations,
as its prologue states.</p>
<p>3. In the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; the monarch is represented
as a mortal who by the divine gift of supernatural Wisdom had gained
immortality; he had become <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=
"#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>privy to the mysteries of God, was
his Beloved, his Son. This was written about the first year of our
era.</p>
<p>4. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews translates the Psalm
xlv. as it is translated above, interpreting the words of deification
as meant for the Firstborn of God at his ancient appearance on earth
(i. 6), and applicable to his reappearance as Christ; arguing from such
language of deification the superiority of the Son of God over the
angels, who were never so addressed.</p>
<p>A court poet addresses a princely bridegroom as <i>Elohim</i>, as a
god&mdash;as it were, an Apollo. Had more songs of like antiquity by
poets of his race been preserved, no doubt other instances of such
rhapsody might be found, but it happens that this is the only instance
in Hebrew literature where an individual man is clearly addressed as
God (for Exod. vii. 1 and 1 Sam. xxviii. 13 are not really exceptions).
As in the Psalm that is the only instance in which an individual man
is, in the Old Testament, addressed as God, so is its application in
the Epistle to the Hebrews the only indisputable instance in which an
individual is addressed as God in the New Testament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy throne, O God.&rdquo; Fateful words! The word of God,
says this Epistle, is sharper than any two-edged sword, but its writer
himself unwittingly unsheathed from a courtier&rsquo;s compliment just
such a sword. One edge has slaughtered innumerable Jews, Moslems,
Arians, Socinians, mingling their blood with that of the humane Jesus
himself on the sacrificial altar he tried so hard to exchange for
mercifulness. The other edge turned against the moral heart of Jesus
himself, lowering the tone of all narratives and utterances ascribed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>to him after his connection with Jahveh, and
consequently lowering all Christendom under its dishonourable burden of
accommodating human veracity and kindness to the bad heavenly manners
that were acquired by the deified Christ. For there was no other God to
adopt him but a particularly rude one.</p>
<p>Theological scholars who have compared the Epistle to the Hebrews
with the Epistles of Paul have dwelt on the theological differences,
but the moral differences are greater. In the Epistle to the Hebrews
the emphasis is laid on the service of Jesus to mankind: it is this
that makes him, as it made Solomon, worthy of worship as a God, and the
ancient God with his sacrifices is virtually represented as
transforming himself and his government to the measure of Jesus. Jesus
is complete and perfect man, no part or power of his divine nature
accompanying him on earth. But we see in Philippians ii. 7, and other
passages, the primitive idea fading away, and Jesus pictured as a
divine being in the mere semblance and disguise of a man, no real man
at all; a theory which prevails in the story of the transfiguration,
where the disguise is for a moment thrown aside. The earlier idea of
his genuine humanity was still strong enough to prevent any stories of
miracles wrought by Jesus from arising, the resurrection being a
miracle wrought by God after the work of Jesus was
&ldquo;finished,&rdquo; as he is said to have proclaimed from the
stake. But legends of miracles became inevitable after the theory of
his disguise was diffused, and also stories of the vituperation,
anathemas, and attitudinizings, which are so offensive in a man, but so
characteristic of the whole history of Jahveh, with whom he was
gradually identified. A gentleman does <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>not call his
opponents vipers and consign them to hell, but Jahveh is not under any
such obligations. And, alas, disregard of the humanities did not, as we
have seen, stop there even in Paul&rsquo;s time. In the further
development, that of Jesus the magician, the personal character of
Jesus was sadly sacrificed, and it is only due to the superstition that
prevents the New Testament narratives from being read in a common sense
way that people generally are not shocked by some of the
representations.</p>
<p>When the second Solomon was born in Bethlehem, as the Gospel carols
tell, Wise Men came to worship him, but Jahveh had already fixed his
own star above the cradle, and his angels contended for the great man,
as for centuries the wisdom of the first Solomon had been jahvized. It
was, however, the opinion of some ancient commentators that the cry of
the angels, &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest&rdquo; meant that the
birth of Jesus was to operate in the heavenly heights, and work changes
there also. One may indeed dream of a deity longing for a human
love,&mdash;grieving at being through ages an object of fear,
personified as Wrath,&mdash;rejoicing in the birth of any new
interpreter who should free him from the despot glory, &ldquo;I create
evil,&rdquo; and reconcile the human heart to him as eternal
love&mdash;love ever burdened with the griefs of humanity, ever seeking
to be born of woman, and to struggle against the dark and evil forces
of nature. So one may dream, and it is a pathetic fact that the
contention between humanity and heaven for the new-born Saviour is
traceable in varying versions of the Angels&rsquo; song. While half of
Christendom sing &ldquo;On earth peace, good will toward men,&rdquo;
the other half sing, &ldquo;On earth peace to men of good <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>will.&rdquo; Our Revisers find the balance of
authorities on the side of authority, and translate</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Glory to God in the highest,</p>
<p class="line">And on earth peace among men in whom he is well
pleased.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Although the &ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo; appears to
treat with a certain contempt the birth-legends and carols in Matthew
and Luke, and the genealogies, beyond the letter of these is visible
more of the vanishing Jesus &ldquo;after the flesh,&rdquo; the real and
great man, than of the risen Christ in whom his humanity was lost. The
&ldquo;shepherd of my people,&rdquo; he who is to absolve them from
their nightmare &ldquo;sins,&rdquo; make crooked ways straight, rough
places smooth, and free them from fear, is remembered in these
rhapsodies of the Infancy, in the terrors of Herod, and gifts of the
Wise. They have a certain evolution in the benevolent teachings and
healing miracles of the Synoptics, easily discriminated from the
competing Jahveh-Christ. (Think of a teacher urging his friends to
forgive offenders seventy times seven and then promising them a
&ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; who will never forgive the slightest offence,
though merely verbal, either in this world or in the next!)</p>
<p>The extent to which the man was lowered and lost in the risen Lord
is especially revealed in the fourth Gospel. Except for the story of
the woman taken in adultery, admittedly interpolated from another
Gospel, the fourth Gospel may be regarded as perhaps the only book in
the Bible without recognition of humanity. &ldquo;I pray not for the
world, but for those whom thou hast given me,&rdquo; is the keynote. In
this work there is no text for the reformer and the philanthropist,
unless perhaps the retreat of Jesus from a prospect of being made king.
What inferences of benevolence might be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>made even from the
miracles related have to be strained through the arrogance,
self-aggrandizement, attitudinizing, as of a showman, with which they
are wrought.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3633src" href="#xd21e3633"
name="xd21e3633src">1</a> A rudeness to his mother precedes the turning
of water to wine (ii. 4); the nobleman&rsquo;s son is healed because
the aristocrat will not believe without a miracle (iv. 48); the infirm
man at Bethesda is healed only after a sham question, &ldquo;Wouldest
thou be made whole?&rdquo; and threatened afterwards (v. 6, 14);
feeding the multitude is attended with another sham question (vi. 5),
and a parade of the fragments (13); the man born blind is declared to
have been so born solely for the sign and wonder manifested in his cure
(ix. 3).</p>
<p>But the supremacy of a new Jahveh over all moral obligations and all
truthfulness is especially displayed in the resurrection of Lazarus
(xi.). Here Jesus is represented as staying away from the sick man, in
order that he may die; he affects to believe Lazarus is only asleep,
but finding his disciples pleased with the prospect of recovery, in
which case there would be no miracle, he becomes frank (<span class=
"trans" title="parrh&#275;sia"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&pi;&alpha;&rho;&#8165;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&#8115;</span></span>)
and assures them Lazarus is dead; he tells his disciples privately he
is glad Lazarus is dead; he tells Martha, when she comes out to him
<i>alone</i>, that her brother shall rise; but when her sister Mary
comes out, accompanied by her Jewish consolers, Jesus breaks out into
vehement groans and lamentations, lashing himself (<span class="trans"
title="etaraxen eauton"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#7952;&tau;&#8049;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&epsilon;&nu;
&#7952;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&#8056;&nu;</span></span>) into this sham
grief over a man at whose death he has connived and who would presently
be alive! Even in his prayer over Lazarus the pretence is kept up, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>his Father is informed, in an aside, &ldquo;I
know that thou hearest me always, but because of the multitude around I
said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.&rdquo; Thus
does the fourth Gospel sink Jesus morally into the grave of Lazarus,
leaving in his place an embodiment of the Jahveh who had lying spirits
to send out into his prophets on occasion.</p>
<p>The resurrection of Lazarus is a transparent fabrication out of the
parable of the rich man and Lazarus. Abraham&rsquo;s words to the rich
man,&mdash;&ldquo;neither will they be persuaded if one rose from the
dead,&rdquo;&mdash;were not adapted to a faith built on a resurrection,
so that parable is suppressed in the fourth Gospel. The resurrection of
a supernatural man is not quite sufficient for people not supernatural.
Those who had been looking for a returning Christ had died, just like
the unbelievers. There was a tremendous necessity for an example of the
resurrection of an ordinary man. Shocking as are the immoral details of
the story, there is audible in it the pathetic cry of the suffering
human heart, and the demand that must be met by any Gospel claiming the
faith of humanity. &ldquo;Lord, if thou hadst been here my brother had
not died!&rdquo; Through what ages has that declaration, not to be
denied, ascended to cold and cruel skies? It is found in the Vedas, in
Job, in the Psalms. If there is a Heart up there why are we tortured?
To the many apologies and explanations and pretences which imperilled
systems had given, Christianity had to support itself by something more
than Egyptian dreams and Platonic speculations. A dead man must arise;
it must be done dramatically, amid domestic grief and neighbourly
sympathy; it must be done doctrinally, with funeral sermon turned to
rejoicings. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>And this was all done in the story of Lazarus in
such a way that it might surround every grave with illusions for
centuries. For who, while tears are falling, will pause to handle the
wreaths, and find whether they are genuine? Who, while the service is
proceeding, will analyze the details, and ask whether it is possible
that the good Jesus could have practiced such deception and assumed
such theatrical attitudes?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3670src" href=
"#xd21e3670" name="xd21e3670src">2</a></p>
<p>The indifference of the fourth Gospel to such moral considerations
as those found in the Synoptics is so apostolic that I am inclined to
place much of it nearer to the first century than I once supposed.
Paul&rsquo;s rage against the &ldquo;wisdom of this world,&rdquo; and
his fulminations against the learned because they are not
&ldquo;called,&rdquo; are fully adopted by the Johannine Christ, who
says to the blind man whose eyes he had opened, and who was worshipping
him: &ldquo;For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not
may see, and they that see may become blind.&rdquo; And these ideas are
represented in a legend related in the book of Acts which is really
allegorical, though our translators have manipulated it into serious
history.</p>
<p>A persecutor of Christians, on whom the spirit &ldquo;came
mightily,&rdquo; as on King Saul, so that he was a new &ldquo;Saul
among the prophets,&rdquo; sought to convert to his new faith a Roman
Proconsul, Sergius Paul. But with this Consul was a learned man of the
Jewish Wisdom School, Bar-Jesus Elymas,&mdash;i. e., Dr. Anti-Jesus
Wise Man. Like Michael and Satan contending for the body <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>of
Moses, Prophet Saul and Anti-Jesus Wise Man contended for the Roman
Paul&rsquo;s soul. Prophet Saul prevailed by calling Anti-Jesus Wise
Man a child of the devil, and striking him blind. Thereupon Consul Paul
believed, being &ldquo;astonished at the teaching of the Lord.&rdquo;
Whereupon Prophet Saul triumphantly carries off the Roman&rsquo;s name
as a trophy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3679src" href="#xd21e3679"
name="xd21e3679src">3</a></p>
<p>Beginning in this conclusive way, by striking human Wisdom sightless
(&ldquo;that they that see may become blind,&rdquo; John ix. 39), the
Anti-Wisdom propaganda, which began with identifying Wisdom with the
serpent in Eden, passed on to inspire the Church Fathers who gloated
over the eternal tortures of the poets and philosophers of Greece and
Rome. Alas for the philosophers not in their graves, but in their
cradles, or in the womb of the future! For torments are nearest
&ldquo;eternal&rdquo; when they begin at once on earth.</p>
<p>One may readily understand how it was that personal traditions of
Jesus and his teachings remained unwritten until his contemporaries
were dead (although this may not have been the case with the suppressed
&ldquo;Gospel according to the Hebrews&rdquo;); the hourly expected
return of Christ rendered such memoirs unimportant until it became
clear that the expectation was erroneous. The age of John, of whom
Jesus was rumoured to have predicted survival till his return
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>(John xxi. 22), was stretched out to a mythical
extent; he became an undying sleeper at Ephesus, and finally a pious
&ldquo;Wandering Jew&rdquo;; but when at length such fables lost their
strength, some imaginative impersonator brought forth an apocalyptic
bequest of John postponing the second advent a thousand years. The
conventicles had thus no resource but to turn into orthodoxy the heresy
of Hymen&oelig;us and Alexander, for which Paul delivered them over to
Satan, that the resurrection occurs at death; to collect the
traditional sayings of Jesus; and to adapt these to the new situation.
A thousand years later, when the expected catastrophe did not occur,
the substantial churches and cathedrals were built, as the Gospels had
been built after the first-century disappointment.</p>
<p>These Gospels contain things from which some of the real teachings
of the wise man of Nazareth may be fairly conjectured. That the
synoptical records are palimpsests, though denied by the prudent, is a
truth felt by the unsophisticated who, in their use of such words as
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; and &ldquo;a Christian spirit,&rdquo; quite
ignore the fearful anathemas and damnatory language ascribed to Jesus.

suggested that Jesus and his friends at Bethany arranged a pretended
death and resurrection of Lazarus. This seems inconsistent with the
absence of any allusion to it or to Lazarus in the Epistles, and also
with the evident relation of the narrative to the parable. It looks
more as if the parable of Lazarus and the rich man had been dramatized
and the return of Lazarus from &ldquo;Abraham&rsquo;s bosom&rdquo;
added. At every step in the narrative (John xi.) there is a suggestion
of some old &ldquo;mystery-play&rdquo; fossilized into prosaic

suggested by the words of Pilate, in many ancient versions of Matt,
xxvii. 16, 17: &ldquo;Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto

Elymas, commonly used as a proper name, means Wise Man. The word

in Matt. ii. 1, where they bring gifts to the infant Christ, but the
same word is made by translators to denote a &ldquo;sorcerer&rdquo;
when the wise man is opposing Paul! Nobody named Sergius Paulus was
known before the Consul of A.D. 94, who must have been long enough dead
for this legend to form before it was written.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter XVIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Last Solomon.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Every race has a pride in its great men which
ultimately prevails over any pious taboo imposed on them in life or by
tradition. Some years ago it was announced that a German scholar was
about to publish proofs that Jesus was not of the Hebrew race, and
while Christendom showed little concern, all Israel sat upon that
German almost furiously. It is an old story. Banished Buddha becomes an
avatar of Vishnu, and his image now appears in India beside Jagenath.
For the heresiarch must be adapted before adoption. So Solomon returns
as a preacher of orthodox Jahvism, in the &ldquo;Wisdom of
Solomon,&rdquo; but so rigid had been the taboo in his case that the
writer did not venture to insert the name of so famous a liberal and
secularist.</p>
<p>That was about the first year of our era. But presently we hear
about the &ldquo;Son of David.&rdquo; Was that because of David
himself? Interest in David had so receded that in the &ldquo;Wisdom of
Solomon&rdquo; the resuscitated Wise Man barely alludes (once) to his
&ldquo;father&rsquo;s seat.&rdquo; Was it because of any popular
interest in the legendary throne or house of David? That old
&ldquo;covenant&rdquo; is not alluded to by the resuscitated monarch,
and in the apostolic writings nothing is said about it. In the Gospels
the title &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo; is generally connected with
certain alleged miracles of Jesus, which recalled legends of Solomon,
and it is only in the account <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208"
href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>of the entry into Jerusalem
that it carries any connotation of royalty corresponding to the
genealogies afterwards elaborated. Unless these narratives are accepted
as historical they must be regarded as phenomena, and, taken in
connection with what may be reasonably regarded as genuine teachings of
Jesus, the phenomena point to a probability that he had reawakened
interest in the Wise Man&rsquo;s teachings, and that this interest, by
a compromise with Jahvist prejudices, coined the expression &ldquo;Son
of David&rdquo; as an <i>alias</i> of Solomon.</p>
<p>However this may be, it appears certain that there was in the
teachings of Jesus some substantial recovery of the ancient and
unconverted Solomon, the proverbial philosopher, the man of the world.
How much Jesus may have said to revive interest in Solomon, and how
many of his secular utterances have been hidden in the grave of his
humanity, can only be conjectured; but there are two direct sayings
concerning Solomon ascribed to him which may be regarded as the only
unreserved tributes to the Wise Man that had ever been uttered since
his idealization in Chronicles. And our own Protestant Jahvism has
tried so hard to manipulate these tributes into partial disparagements
that we may easily imagine early Christian Jahvism destroying similar
testimonies altogether.</p>
<p>A. S. V. Luke xi. 31: &ldquo;The Queen of the South shall rise up in
judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them: for she came
from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
and behold a greater than Solomon is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True rendering: &ldquo;The Queen of the South shall stand in the
judgment with the men of this [Abrahamic] <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>brood, and condemn
them; for she came from the farthest parts of the earth to hear the
wisdom of Solomon, and behold something more than Solomon is
here.&rdquo; (<span class="trans" title=
"pleion Solom&#333;nos h&#333;de"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;
&Sigma;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&mu;&#8182;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&#8035;&delta;&epsilon;</span></span>)</p>
<p>The word mistranslated &ldquo;greater,&rdquo; <span class="trans"
title="pleion"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;</span></span>, is neuter
and cannot be applied to a man. Jesus is not speaking of himself, but
of the new Spirit animating a whole movement.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;generation&rdquo; as a translation of <span class=
"trans" title="genea"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&#8051;&alpha;</span></span> is, in this
connection, misleading. No one English word can convey the satire on
people who regarded themselves as holy by generation from Abraham (cf.
Luke iii. 8), which is in the vein of Carlyle&rsquo;s ridicule of
English &ldquo;Paper Nobility.&rdquo; Above these self-satisfied
claimants of inherited wisdom Jesus sets the Gentile Queen journeying
to sit at the feet of Solomon. At the feet of Solomon Jesus also was
sitting, and he certainly did not call himself personally greater than
Solomon.</p>
<p>The other allusion to Solomon (Matt. vi. 28, 29) is rendered thus:
&ldquo;Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they toil not,
neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all
his glory was not arrayed like one of these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here &ldquo;glory,&rdquo; which when applied to a man has a
connotation of pride and pomp, is made to translate <span class="trans"
title="dox&#275;"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&delta;&#8057;&xi;&#8053;</span></span>, which means honour in its
best sense, as preserved in &ldquo;doxology.&rdquo; Jesus really says,
&ldquo;Solomon amid all his honours never arrayed himself (<span class=
"trans" title="periebaleto"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&epsilon;&beta;&#8049;&lambda;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;</span></span>)
like one of these.&rdquo; The greatest and wisest of men did not affect
display in dress.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3770src" href="#xd21e3770"
name="xd21e3770src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>The apparent slightness of these English changes reveals their
deliberate subtlety. Puritanism, taking its cue from King James&rsquo;s
translators, has bettered the instruction, and steadily pictured Jesus
pointing to a lily,&mdash;white emblem of purity,&mdash;and censuring
(implicitly) the ostentation of Solomon. Even in rationalistic
hymn-books is found the pretty hymn of Agnes Strickland, beginning:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Fair lilies of Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="line xd21e976">Ye wear the same array</p>
<p class="line">As when imperial Judah&rsquo;s stem</p>
<p class="line xd21e976">Maintained its regal sway:</p>
<p class="line">By sacred Jordan&rsquo;s desert tide</p>
<p class="line xd21e976">As bright ye blossom on</p>
<p class="line">As when your simple charms outvied</p>
<p class="line xd21e976">The pride of Solomon.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Very sweet! But the &ldquo;lilies of the field&rdquo;
in Palestine are not &ldquo;fair,&rdquo; their charms are not
&ldquo;simple&rdquo;; they are large and gorgeous combinations of red
and gold; and Solomon, so far from being proud in the contrast,
&ldquo;outvied&rdquo; in simplicity the pride of the lily.</p>
<p>Jesus may not indeed have said these things concerning Solomon, but
the probability that he did say something of the kind is suggested by
the adroit mistranslations. The same puritanical spirit, the same
prejudice against human wisdom and love of beauty, prevailed even more
when the Gospels were written. The Jahvist jealousy of the wisdom of
the world which in a Targum added to Jeremiah ix. 23 a fling at
Solomon,&mdash;&ldquo;Let not <i>Solomon the Son of David</i>, the Wise
Man, glory in his Wisdom,<span class="corr" id="xd21e3807" title=
"Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span>&mdash;screamed on in Christian
anathemas on science, and laudations of the silly. (For
&ldquo;silly&rdquo; is of pious derivation, from German <i lang=
"de">selig</i>&mdash;blessed.) Solomon had not been named in any
canonical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>scripture for centuries, and even in apocryphal
&ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; (Ecclesiasticus) he appears as if a brilliant but
fallen Lucifer. The cult of Solomon continued no doubt, in a sense,
among the Sadducees (respectfully treated, by the way, by Jesus), but
they were comparatively few, and like the rationalists of the English
Church, cautious about outside heresies. It was probably characteristic
that their name is derived from Solomon&rsquo;s priest, Zadok, instead
of from Solomon himself. As for the Gentile Queen, she is not named in
the Bible after the record of her visit to Solomon until the homage of
Jesus was given her. It appears, therefore, very unlikely that such
homage and the unqualified tributes to Solomon, would have been put
into the mouth of Jesus.</p>
<p>But why, it may be asked, were not these tributes suppressed? There
is in one case a recognition of a Gentile lady which would recommend
the text to the writer of Luke, and in the other a lesson against
luxury which would recommend this to all believers. At any rate,
whatever may have been the suppressions, and no doubt there were many,
two of the Gospels have preserved these sentences, which, so far as the
glorious &ldquo;idolator&rdquo; is concerned, neither of them would
have invented. There are the words; somebody uttered them; and the
question arises, who was that daring man who broke the severe silence
or reservations of centuries and did honour to the king who built
shrines to gods and goddesses?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3817src"
href="#xd21e3817" name="xd21e3817src">2</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>As Solomon said, &ldquo;A man is proved by what he praises.&rdquo;
That Jesus did appreciate the greatness of the Solomonic literature is
not a matter of conjecture. The sayings ascribed to him in the
Gospels&mdash;apart from Pauline importations and quotations from
Jahvist scriptures&mdash;are largely pervaded by the spirit and even by
the phraseology of the Solomonic books. Remembering that the phrases
&ldquo;kingdom of heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;kingdom of God,&rdquo; are
post-resurrectional, and that Jesus could not, unless by miraculous
foresight, use those phrases for any external dominion connected with
himself, there is reason to believe that his conception was of a
<i>sway</i> of Wisdom, and that Wisdom was to him the Saviour, as to
Jesus Ben Sira, her realm &ldquo;within,&rdquo; her leaven hid in the
world, her advance without observation.</p>
<p>Of course those who read the Bible in the light of a supernatural
theory, see these things very differently, but considering the records
as if they were those of uninspired people, one may say that some of
the sayings ascribed to Jesus are, in their present form, meaningless.
For example, what should we think if we found an ancient record of some
poor Egyptian reported as saying, &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that
labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly of heart: and ye shall
find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is
light.&rdquo; How incongruous the &ldquo;I am meek&rdquo; with
&ldquo;learn of me&rdquo;! How could he give the heavy laden rest? And
what rest? what yoke? But we would surely feel enlightened should we
presently discover an Egyptian book of &ldquo;Wisdom,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>with proof of its popularity when the mysterious
words were orally repeated, containing such language as this from
personified Wisdom: &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me,
and fill yourselves with my fruits.&rdquo; And if we found in the same
book a teacher saying: &ldquo;I directed my soul unto Wisdom, and I
found her in pureness.... Draw near unto me, ye unlearned, and dwell in
the house of Wisdom.... Buy her for yourselves without money. Put your
neck under her yoke, and let your life receive instruction: she is near
at hand to find. Behold with your eyes that I have had but little
labour, and have gotten unto me much rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is sense. These are the words of Wisdom in Jesus Ben Sira
(Ecclesiasticus xxiv. 19, li. 23&ndash;27). Can any unbiased mind fail
to recognize in Matthew xi. 28&ndash;30 a mangled quotation from this
Hebrew book of the second century, before Jesus of Nazareth was born,
but in his time cherished in many Jewish households as much as any
Gospel is cherished in Christian households?</p>
<p>Consider the Sermon on the Mount. In the Proverbs ascribed to
Solomon is found the beatitude pronounced by Jesus on the lowly, no
doubt literally quoted by him: &ldquo;With the lowly is wisdom&rdquo;
(Prov. xi. 2). The blessing of those who hunger for righteousness
(justice) is in Prov. x. 24, where it is said their desire shall be
granted. The blessing of the peacemakers is joy (Prov. xii. 20). The
merciful man doeth good to his own life (Prov. xi. 17). The pure in
heart shall have the King for his friend (Prov. xxii. 11). The house
that stands and the house overthrown (Prov. x. 25; xii. 7; xiv. 11);
the two ways (Prov. xii. 28, xiv. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214"
href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>12, xvi. 17); the tree known
by its fruits (Prov. xi. 30, xii. 12); give and it shall be given you
(Prov. xxii. 9); the sower (Prov. xi. 18, 24, 25); taking the lower
place so as to be placed higher and not moved down (Prov. xxv.
6&ndash;8); searching for and buying Wisdom as the precious silver, the
pearl, the treasure (Prov. vi. 11, 12, 17, 19, 35; xx. 15; xxiii. 23);
the prodigal (Prov. xxix. 3); those who wrong parents (Prov. xx. 20;
xxviii. 24; cf. Matt. xv. 5; Mark vii. 11). The lamps of the wise and
foolish virgins are found in Prov. xiii. 9; also xxiv. 20.</p>
<p>In Proverbs xx. 9, we have the words, &ldquo;Who can say, &lsquo;I
have made my heart clean, I am pure from sin?&rsquo;&rdquo; In
Ecclesiastes iii. 16, it is said, &ldquo;Moreover, I saw under the sun,
in the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and in the place
of righteousness that wickedness was there.&rdquo; (Cf. also vii. 20.)
In the &ldquo;Gospel according to the Hebrews&rdquo; Jesus, declaring
that an offender should be forgiven seventy times seven, adds:
&ldquo;For in the prophets likewise, after they were anointed by the
Holy Spirit, utterance of sin was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although in the language ascribed to Jesus in the fourth Gospel
(iii. 1&ndash;10) there are post-resurrectional phrases, whatever he
may have said about birth and about the wind-like spirit seems to have
been what he expected Nicodemus, as a teacher in Israel, to understand.
We may therefore suppose that it was substantially a quotation from
Ecclesiastes xi. 5: &ldquo;As thou knowest not the way of the wind, nor
the growth of the bones in the mother&rsquo;s womb, even so thou canst
not fathom the work of God, who compasseth all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In relation to Woman Jesus seems to have appealed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>to
Solomon against Ecclesiastes, where (vii. 25&ndash;29) it is said:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I have turned my heart to know,</p>
<p class="line">And to explore, and search out wisdom and the reason
<i>of things</i>;</p>
<p class="line">And to know that wickedness is Folly, and Folly
madness:</p>
<p class="line">And I have found what is more bitter than
death&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">The Woman who is a snare, her heart nets, her hands
chains:</p>
<p class="line">He who pleases God shall be delivered from her,</p>
<p class="line">But the offender shall be captured by her.</p>
<p class="line xd21e976">See, this have I found (saith the
Speaker).</p>
<p class="line"><i>Adding</i> one to another, to find out the
account,</p>
<p class="line">Which I am still searching after, but have not
found&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">One man in a thousand I have found,</p>
<p class="line">But a woman among all these I have not found.</p>
<p class="line">Look you, only this have I found&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">That God made man upright,</p>
<p class="line">But they have sought out many devices.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the first seven lines of this passage we may
recognize the personification in Proverbs ix. 13&ndash;18. The Woman of
the fifth line is &ldquo;Dame Folly&rdquo;; but the last eight lines
relate to womankind. The assurance in the eighth line that it is
Koheleth who speaks raises a suspicion that the last eight lines are
commentary,&mdash;a suspicion further confirmed by the awkwardness of
the writing. Strictly read, it is left uncertain whether no woman is
ever captured by Dame Folly, or not one escapes. However, as
commentators are generally men, the interpretation has been adverse to
woman.</p>
<p>But Jesus, perhaps remembering that Wisdom is as much a woman as
Folly, is reported (Matthew xi. 19) to have said: &ldquo;Wisdom is
justified by her works.&rdquo; In Luke vii. 35 it is, &ldquo;Wisdom is
justified of all her children.&rdquo; Both of these readings appeal to
the Solomonic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>portrait of the virtuous woman, in Proverbs
xxxi. the last line of which says, &ldquo;Let her works praise
her,&rdquo; and verse 28, &ldquo;her children rise up and call her
blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Luke the sentence is a verse by itself, and the word
&ldquo;all&rdquo; renders it probable that the sentiment has a bearing
on the story that follows of the anointing of Jesus by a sinful
woman.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3895src" href="#xd21e3895" name=
"xd21e3895src">3</a> Some such incident may have occurred, but the
address to Simon the Pharisee making him to be the offender, and the
woman one delivered from Dame Folly by her faith (&ldquo;pleasing
God&rdquo;) looks like a criticism on the &ldquo;fling&rdquo; at woman
in Ecclesiastes, with a proverb taken for text. This rebuke of the
Pharisee, who thought &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo; ought to abhor the
&ldquo;sinner,&rdquo; immediately precedes an account of the eminent
women who supported Jesus by their means,&mdash;Mary, called Magdalene;
Joanna, the wife of Herod&rsquo;s steward; Susanna, &ldquo;and many
others.&rdquo; They &ldquo;ministered to him of their substance,&rdquo;
and possibly the Pharisee and others might naturally suspect him of
being among &ldquo;the ensnared.&rdquo; The fact is strange enough to
be genuine, and Luke thinks it important to say that Jesus had healed
these ladies of bad spirits and infirmities. Of course it is necessary
to divest Gospel anecdotes of much post-resurrectional vesture, and in
this case it cannot be credited that Jesus said that the woman&rsquo;s
sins were &ldquo;many,&rdquo; which he could not have known, or that he
gave her formal absolution.</p>
<p>The indications of the study of Ecclesiasticus by Jesus are very
remarkable. This book appears to have been a sort of nursery in which
proverbs were trained for their fruitage in the last Solomon&rsquo;s
religious testimonies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href=
"#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>What those testimonies were we
cannot easily gather, but it is useful for comparative study to remark
the sentences in Ecclesiastictus which correspond, either in thought or
phraseology, with those ascribed to Jesus. The broad and the narrow
ways barely suggested in &ldquo;Proverbs&rdquo; are here developed
(Ecclesiasticus iv. 17, 18). &ldquo;Hide not thy wisdom&rdquo; (iv. 23,
xx. 30). &ldquo;Say not, &lsquo;I have enough (goods) for my
life&rsquo;&rdquo; (v. 1, xi. 24). &ldquo;Extol not thyself&rdquo; (vi.
2). We find the exhortation to judge not (vii. 6); rebuke of much
speaking in prayer (14); warning against the lustful gaze (ix. 5, 8);
the night cometh when no man can work (xiv. 16&ndash;19; cf. Eccles.
ix. 10); the proud cast down, the humble exalted (x. 14, xi. 5); one
only is good (xviii. 2); swear not (xxiii. 9); forgiven as we forgive
(xxviii. 2); treasure rusting and treasure laid up according to the
commandments of the Most High (xxix. 10, 11); &ldquo;Judge of thy
neighbor by thyself&rdquo; (xxxi. 15); the altar-gift and the wronged
brother (xxxiv. 18&ndash;20); he that seeks the law shall be filled
(xxxii. 15); charity and not sacrifice (xxxv. 2).</p>
<p>These resemblances, of which more might be quoted, between teachings
ascribed to Jesus and passages in the Wisdom Books, are so important
that by the aid of these books some of the confused utterances
attributed to him may be made clear.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3904src" href="#xd21e3904" name="xd21e3904src">4</a> Apart from
the importations of Paul, and one or two from the epistle to the
Hebrews, no reference by the Jesus of the Gospels <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>to
Jahvist books can be shown of similar significance. Combined as his
Solomonic ideas are with his homage to Solomon and the Gentile Queen,
and followed, as we shall see, by a resuscitation of Solomonic legends
in connection with him, it appears clear that Jesus was of the
Solomonic and anti-Jahvist school.</p>
<p>It would, however, be a great mistake to suppose that Jesus was
simply a philosophical and ethical teacher. He cannot be so explained.
The fragmentary sayings, so far as discoverable amid their
post-resurrectional perversions, have the air of <i>obiter dicta</i>
from a man engaged in a local propaganda of subversive principles. What
the propaganda really was is but dimly discernible under its own
subsequent subversion by his ghost, but there are a few sayings not
traceable to his predecessors, and beyond the capacity of his
contemporaries or his successors, which bring us near to an individual
mind, and suggest the general nature of the agitation he caused.</p>
<p>The story of the woman taken in adultery, known to have been in the
suppressed &ldquo;Gospel according to the Hebrews,&rdquo; and by some
strange chance preserved in the fourth gospel (viii), I believe to have
really occurred. It would have required a first-century <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e3916" title="Source: Boccacio">Boccaccio</span> to
invent such a story, and I cannot discover anything similar in Eastern
or in Oriental books. Augustine says that some had removed it from
their manuscripts, &ldquo;I imagine, out of fear that impunity of sin
was granted to their wives.&rdquo; It is not likely that any of the
earlier fathers, any more than the later, would have invented so
dangerous a story.</p>
<p>Another anecdote, preserved only in the fourth Gospel, probably
contains some elements of truth, namely, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>the words uttered to
the Samaritan woman. Who would have been bold enough, even had he been
liberal enough, to invent the words: &ldquo;Neither in this mountain,
nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father&rdquo;? Even in the one
Gospel that ventures to preserve it this noble catholicity is
immediately retracted (John iv. 22) in a verse which obviously
interrupts the idea. That the story is an early one is also suggested
by the fact that no reproach to the woman on account of her many
husbands is inserted. It is remarkable to find such a story related
without any word about sin and forgiveness.</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;Sermon on the Mount&rdquo; is well named: it is
evidently made up of reports of sermons in amplification of sayings of
Jesus in the style of the Wisdom Books, among which probably were:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Let your light shine before men. A lamp is not
lit to be put under a bushel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lamp of the body is the eye. If thine eye be sound the
whole body is illumined; if the eye be diseased the whole body is in
darkness. If the inner eye be darkened how great is the
darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By their fruits both trees and man are known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each tree is known by its <i>own</i> fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put not new wine into old wine-skins, lest they
burst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisdom is justified by her children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any man will be great, let him serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lowly shall be exalted, the proud humbled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind guides strain out the gnat, and swallow a
camel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give and it shall be given you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The measure ye mete shall be measured to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast the beam from thine eye before noticing the mote in that
of thy neighbour.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>The following sentences in the &ldquo;Gospel according to the
Hebrews&rdquo; do not appear to have been very seriously influenced by
post-resurrectional ideas.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;He is a great criminal who hath grieved the
spirit of his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank to you if you love them that love you, but there is
thank if ye love your enemies and them that hate you.&rdquo; (Cf. Prov.
xxix. 17, 29.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ye never joyful save when you have looked upon your
brother in charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be as lambkins in midst of wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son and the daughter shall inherit alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is happy rather to give than to receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No servant can serve two masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of entire heart and out of entire mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the profit if a man gain the entire world, and lose
his life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seek from little to wax great, and not from greater to become
less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Become proved bankers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye have not been faithful in the little who will give you
the great?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>These instructions have no connotations of the end of the world.
They appear like the words of a man of the world, but not a man of the
people. There is a certain unity in them, indicating a mind more
developed than the semi-Jahvist Alexandrian philosophers of the later
Wisdom cult, as represented by Jesus Ben Sira&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Wisdom,&rdquo; and by the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo;; also
a mind more practical.</p>
<p>But these wise sayings do not convey the full idea of a man whose
execution the Sanhedrim would require, nor a man whose resurrection
from the grave would be looked for by the populace. These two
phenomenal facts imply some strong antagonism to the priesthood and
their system. Martyrdoms do not occur for ethical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>generalizations, much less for philosophical
affirmations. The faith that strikes deep is that which speaks in great
denials.</p>
<p>Trying to follow his advice to &ldquo;Become proved bankers,&rdquo;
we may detect in some probable sayings of Jesus a transitional ring,
<i>e. g.</i>, &ldquo;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
Sabbath.&rdquo; The effort at self-emancipation is still more traceable
in certain incidents related in the &ldquo;Gospel according to the
Hebrews&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;He saith, &lsquo;If thy brother hath offended
in anything and hath made thee amends, seven times in a day receive
him,&rsquo; Simon his disciple said unto him, &lsquo;Seven times in a
day?&rsquo; The Lord answered and said unto him, &lsquo;I tell thee
also unto seventy times seven; for in the prophets likewise, after that
they were anointed by the Holy Spirit, utterance of sin was
found.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same day, having beheld a man working on the Sabbath, he
said to him, &lsquo;Man, if thou knowest what thou dost, blessed art
thou: but if thou knowest not, thou art under a curse, and a
law-breaker.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>That a man should regard the Holy Spirit as unable to make men
infallible; that he should have discovered immoral utterances in the
prophets; that he should regard it as a sign of enlightenment to
disregard the Sabbath deliberately and intelligently&mdash;this is
surely all very striking.</p>
<p>Who, in the second century, could have invented these anecdotes
about Jesus? They are not harmonious with the Pauline Epistles; their
heretical character is proved by the repudiation of the Gospel
containing them, while their genuineness is implicitly confessed by the
ultimate suppression of that Gospel. For surely it cannot be supposed
that such a work, well known in the fifth century, was lost; nor is
there much doubt that any learned rationalist, if permitted the free
range <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>of all the libraries in Rome, without the
presence of polite librarians, could bring to light that first-century
Gospel, the only one written in Aramaic, the language of Jesus.</p>
<p>But, when we come to consider the mature and positive teachings of
Jesus, there may be placed in the front a sentence preserved from the
suppressed Gospel by Epiphanius, who writes (<i>Haer</i><span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4017" title="Not in source">.</span> xxx. 16):
&ldquo;And they say that he both came, and (as their so-called Gospel
has it) instructed them that he had come to dissolve the Sacrifices:
&lsquo;and unless ye cease from sacrificing the wrath shall not cease
from you.&rsquo;&rdquo; Dr. Nicholson is shocked at this threat, and
suspects the Ebionites of having altered what Jesus said. But surely it
is a true and grand admonition by one superseding a phantasm of
heavenly Egoism, demanding gifts from men for pacification, with the
idea of a Father. Dr. Nicholson connects it, no doubt rightly, with
Luke xiii. 1&ndash;3, which should probably read: &ldquo;There were
some present at that very season who told him of the Galileans whose
blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And he answered, Think
ye these Galileans were sinners rather than all other Galileans because
they suffered these things? I tell you, No! And unless ye cease from
sacrificing, the Wrath will not cease from you.&rdquo; That is, they
would always be haunted by the delusion of a bloodthirsty god, a god of
Wrath, and see a judgment, not only in every accident, but in every
calamity wrought by fiendish men.</p>
<p>In his quotation from Hosea&mdash;&ldquo;I desire charity, and not
sacrifice&rdquo;&mdash;Jesus speaks as if with a transitional accent,
as compared with the declaration that sacrifices <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>imply deified Wrath. The contempt of
Ecclesiastes for &ldquo;the sacrifice of fools who know not that they
are doing evil&rdquo; (v. 1), has here become a great and far-reaching
affirmation, which must have impressed the orthodox Jews as atheism.
For, although there are passages in several psalms and in the prophets
which disparage sacrifice, they were all interpreted by the Rabbins, as
now by Christian theologians, as meaning their purification and
spiritualization&mdash;by no means their abolition. Indeed, this higher
interpretation of sacrifices appears to have given them fresh lease;
and in the time of Jesus, when to the priesthood remained only control
over their religious ordinances, the sacrifices were apparently
preserved with increased rigour. Jesus himself, unless the gospeller
(Matt. v. 23, 24) has softened his language, had at one time only
demanded that none should offer a gift at the altar until he had done
justice to any who had aught against him. But a remarkable passage in
the Epistle to the Hebrews (x. 5) represents Jesus as going to the
world with a quotation from Psalm xl. 6, 7, for a clause of which a
parenthesis is given, saying:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst
not</p>
<p class="line">(Thou hast furnished me this body)&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">In whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou
delighted not:</p>
<p class="line">Then said I (in that chapter of the book it is written
for me),</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;Lo, I come to do thy will, O
God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The sentence preserved by Eusebius, however, shows
that his attitude toward sacrifices was not merely to
&ldquo;lift&rdquo; from men (Heb. x. 9, <span class="trans" title=
"anairei"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#7936;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&epsilon;&#8150;</span></span>) the
burden of sacrifice, but to denounce it as an offering to the devil.
&ldquo;Unless ye cease from sacrificing, the Wrath shall not cease from
you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>In this sentence &ldquo;the Wrath&rdquo; (<span class="trans" title=
"h&#275; org&#275;"><span class="Greek" lang="el">&#7969;
&#8000;&rho;&gamma;&#8053;</span></span>) is clearly a personification.
It does not in the same form occur elsewhere in the Bible. Matthew and
Mark report John the Baptist as speaking of &ldquo;the impending
wrath,&rdquo; and Paul occasionally gives &ldquo;Wrath&rdquo; a
quasi-personification (e. g., &ldquo;children of Wrath,&rdquo; Eph. ii.
1&ndash;3). These expressions, and the &ldquo;destroyer&rdquo; Abaddon
or Apollyon, of Revelations ix. and (xii. 12) the devil &ldquo;in great
temper&rdquo; (<span class="trans" title="thymon"><span class="Greek"
lang="el">&theta;&upsilon;&mu;&#8056;&nu;</span></span>), all show that
the Jewish mind had become familiar with the idea of a dark and evil
power quite detached from official relation to Jahveh, no longer
&ldquo;the wrath of God&rdquo; executing divine judgments, but
organized Violence, eager to afflict mankind as the creation of his
enemy.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; (xviii.) there is a complete
picture of the two opposing Destroyers. The divine destroyer
(&ldquo;thine Almighty Word&rdquo;) leaps down with his sword and slays
the firstborn of Egypt; the antagonist Destroyer begins the same kind
of work among the Israelites in Egypt, but Moses by prayer and the
&ldquo;propitiation of incense&rdquo; sets himself &ldquo;against the
Wrath&rdquo; and overcomes him,&mdash;&ldquo;not with physical
strength, nor force of arms, but with a word.&rdquo; The incense used
by Moses to put the demon to flight recalls the &ldquo;perfume&rdquo;
used by Tobit, on the advice of the angel, to put to flight Asmodeus;
and Asmodeus is notoriously the Persian A&ecirc;shma, a name meaning
&ldquo;Wrath,&rdquo; who occupies so large space in the Pars&icirc;
scriptures.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4067src" href="#xd21e4067" name=
"xd21e4067src">5</a> The especial antagonist of A&ecirc;shma &ldquo;of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>wounding spear,&rdquo; is Sraosha, &ldquo;the
incarnate Word, a mighty-speared god.&rdquo; (Farvardin Yast, 85.) As
Moses overcomes &ldquo;the Wrath&rdquo; &ldquo;with a word,&rdquo;
Zoroaster is given a form of words to conquer A&ecirc;shma
(&ldquo;Praise to Arma&icirc;ti, the propitious!&rdquo;) and the
Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d says, &ldquo;The fiend becomes weaker and weaker
at every one [repetition] of those words.&rdquo; The Zamy&acirc;d Yast
says, &ldquo;The Word of falsehood smites, but the Word of truth shall
smite it.&rdquo; A&ecirc;shma is the child of Ahriman, the Deceiver of
the World, and a Pars&icirc; would recognize him in the declaration
ascribed to Jesus, &ldquo;The devil is a liar and so is his
father.&rdquo; (John viii. 44.)</p>
<p>That Jesus regarded the whole realm of evil as absolutely
antagonistic to the Good is reflected in the epistle &ldquo;To the
Hebrews.&rdquo; There his mission is to abolish the devil (ii. 14),
which is very different from abolishing death (2 Tim. i. 10). For a
long time the devil was suppressed in the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer,&rdquo; but in that brief collection of Talmudic ejaculations
the only original thing is, &ldquo;Deliver us from the evil one.&rdquo;
In the Clementine Homilies Jesus is quoted as having said, &ldquo;The
evil one is the tempter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Give not a pretext to the
evil one.&rdquo; Nay, the single clause preserved in Matthew, that it
is an enemy that sows tares,&mdash;these being as much parts of nature
as corn,&mdash;is a sentence that divides the Ahrimanic creation from
the Ahuramazdean creation as clearly and profoundly as anything
ascribed to Zoroaster.</p>
<p>Theological harmonists have for centuries been at work on the
contrarious doctrines of all scriptures, and even among the
Pars&icirc;s some kind of metaphysical alliance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>has
taken place between the Kingdoms of Good and Evil. Devout Christians
find it quite consistent that one person of the trinity should say,
&ldquo;I create good and I create evil,&rdquo; and another person of
the trinity should say of natural evil, &ldquo;An enemy hath done
this.&rdquo; But no such harmony existed in the Jerusalem of Jesus.
Under a teaching that symbolized the deity as the Sun, shining alike on
the thankful and thankless, individually, desiring no sacrifices, and
concentrating human effort against the forces of evil in nature, in
society&mdash;the evil principle&mdash;Jahveh falls like lightning from
heaven. Like &ldquo;the blameless man&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Wisdom of
Solomon,&rdquo; Jesus &ldquo;sets himself against the Wrath,&rdquo;
however sanctified as the Wrath of God, and sees all sacrifices as
eucharists of the Adversary. He not only repudiates the name
&ldquo;Jahveh,&rdquo; but tells the official agents of Jahvism that
their god is his devil. (John viii. 44).</p>
<p>Of course one can only refer cautiously to anything in the fourth
Gospel, for it is a composite book, but it contains, as I believe,
passages or fragments of the early apostolic theology, wherein dualism,
until crushed by Paul, was prominent, and the good God represented in
hard struggle with Satan for the rescue of mankind.</p>
<p>This aspect of the teaching of Jesus cannot be dealt with here as
its importance deserves. We live in an age whose clergy deal
apologetically with the prominence of the Adversary of Man in the
teachings of Jesus. For this fundamental principle of Jesus Jewish
monotheism has been substituted. But there are many records to attest
that the moral perfection and benevolence <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>of the deity, which
is certainly inconsistent with his omnipotence, or his
&ldquo;permission&rdquo; of the tares in nature, was the only new
principle of religion affirmed by Jesus; and, also, that it was so
subversive of sacrifices, priesthood, and the very foundations of the
temple&mdash;all dependent on Jahveh&rsquo;s menaces&mdash;that the
execution of Jesus appears more rationally explicable by this dualistic
propaganda than by any other ascribed to him.</p>
<p>It was the birth of a new God that moved Jerusalem: a unique God in
Judea&mdash;and almost unknown in modern Christendom&mdash;namely, a
<span class="sc">Good</span> God. As the Arabian gospel significantly
relates, the Eastern Wise Men came to the cradle of Jesus as that of a
saviour &ldquo;prophesied by Zoroaster,&rdquo;&mdash;the one prophet
who separated deity from the realm of evil.</p>
<p>It is now even unorthodox to deny that the agonies of nature are
part of the providence of God: but herein orthodoxy is in direct
antagonism to what it maintains as the authentic teaching of Jesus.
&ldquo;Then was brought unto him one possessed of a devil, blind and
dumb; and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw. And
all the multitudes were amazed and said, Is this the Son of David? But
when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out
devils but by Beelzebub, the prince of devils. And knowing their
thoughts he said, Every dominion divided against itself is brought to
desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not
stand; and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself:
how then shall his dominion stand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those therefore who believe these to be the words of Jesus, and yet
believe blindness, dumbness, and other <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>physical diseases to
be in any sense of divine providence or even permission, are believing
in a God whom Jesus implicitly pronounced to be Satan.</p>
<p>And those who do not believe that Jesus healed such diseases, nor
believe in a personal Satan, may still regard the above legend as
characteristic. The separation of Good and Evil into eternally
antagonistic dominions could not have been affirmed by any Jew other
than Jesus (or John the Baptist, probably however an Oriental dervish).
Though the Jews popularly believed in Beelzebub and other devils, they
were all regarded as under the omnipotence and control of Jahveh, who
proudly claimed that he was the creator of all evil, and who even had
lying spirits in his employ.</p>
<p>Whether Jesus believed in the personality of the evil principle, in
any strict sense, may be questioned. He may have meant no more than
Emerson, who pictured ill health as a ghoul preying on the heart and
life of its victims. Memories of similar teachings may have given rise
to the tales of healing afterwards associated with Jesus. But the
personality of evil is a more philosophical generalization than the
personification of a power representing both the good and the evil
phenomena of nature. Evil acts in concrete forms, and often in
combinations of forces which can not be analysed and distributed into
particular causes. History records instances of moral epidemics driving
whole peoples as if down a steep place into seas of blood, as if by
some pandemoniac possession, impressing the ordinarily humane along
with the vindictive, the lawless and destructive. A great deal of crime
seems disinterested, and still more is due to the fanatical inspiration
of cruel deities, whose names become in other religions the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>names of devils. Out of manifold experiences in
the tragical annals of mankind came the terrible Ahriman.</p>
<p>That Jesus did not adopt the Zoroastrian theology is shown in his
hostility to sacrifices which are of vital importance in the
Pars&icirc; system, though they were not of the cruel kind; nor, as we
have seen, were they to propitiate gods, but to assist them. Moreover,
belief in Ahriman had naturally evoked a militant spirit in the war
against evil, and Jesus seems to have for this reason separated himself
from the dervish, John the Baptist, whose violence had landed him in
prison. The incident (Matt. xi.) is so wrapped in post-resurrectional
phraseology that any rational interpretation must be conjectural; but
there is a certain accent about it which can hardly be explained as
part of the evangelical doctrine that the Baptist was a mere preface to
Christ. Jesus seems to regard John the Baptizer as the ablest man of
his time (verse 11), but as of a revolutionary spirit, as if the
reformation were a siege against some political kingdom or throne.
Violent people had been pressing around John, and the cause of
spiritual liberation had suffered. There was too much of the old law
with its thunders, too much of fiery Elijah, surviving in John. The
ideal is not a thing to be clutched at, or taken by force, but all of
the conditions&mdash;every tittle&mdash;must be fulfilled. (Luke xvi.
17.)</p>
<p>This is in substance a doctrine of evolution as opposed to
revolution, and my interpretation may be suspected of rationalistic
anachronism; but it must be remembered that the Golden Age behind
Israel was an epoch of Peace, which was represented in the ancient name
of their city (Salem), and of its greatest monarch, Solomon. The
prophets had long been painting the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>visionary dawn with
pigments of that glorious sunset. Solomon, true to his name, had
allowed dismemberment of his kingdom rather than go to war against
rebellion; and it is noticeable that in the apostolic age there was a
principle against carnal weapons, the Epistle to the Hebrews (xii. 3,
4) especially reminding the brethren of the patient endurance of Jesus,
and commending their not having &ldquo;resisted unto blood.&rdquo; This
peacefulness of Jesus had indeed become a basis of the doctrine that
the triumph of Jesus over Satan was conditioned on his not using any
force, or other satanic weapon. Those who took to the sword would
perish thereby&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, remain in sheol.</p>
<p>But in a realm of practically oppressive and cruel superstitions,
established and consecrated, an absolute appeal to the moral sentiment
cannot escape being revolutionary. The American Anti-Slavery Society
were non-resistants; their great leader, William Lloyd Garrison, thus
apostrophised his &ldquo;elder brother&rdquo; of Jerusalem:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Jesus! noblest of patriots, greatest of heroes, most
glorious of all martyrs! Thine is the spirit of universal liberty and
love&mdash;of uncompromising hostility to every form of injustice and
wrong. But not with weapons of death dost thou assault thy enemies,
that they may be vanquished or destroyed; for thou dost not wrestle
against flesh and blood, but against &lsquo;principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness in high places&rsquo;; therefore hast thou put on
the whole armor of God, having the loins girt about with truth, and
having on the breastplate of righteousness, and thy feet shod with the
preparation of the gospel of peace, and going forth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>to
battle with the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, the sword of
the Spirit! Worthy of imitation art thou, in overcoming the evil that
is in the world; for by the shedding of thine own blood, but not even
the blood of thy bitterest foe, shalt thou at last obtain a universal
victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, across the ages, does deep answer unto deep. But all the same
Garrison&rsquo;s feet were unconsciously shod with the preparation of
the gospel of war, even as those of Jesus were. In a realm of
consecrated wrong every appeal to the moral sentiment is necessarily
revolutionary; far more so than physical rebellion, against which
preponderant moral forces combine with the immoral, as being a greater
evil than the orderly wrong assailed. Satan cannot be cast out by
Beelzebub. A god of wrath, enthroned on reeking altars, could better
stand the axe of the Baptist than the sunbeam of Jesus, the arrow
feathered with gentleness and culture. John the Baptist was not a
religious martyr; he suffered from a ruler quite indifferent to his
religion, with whose personal affairs he had interfered. But Jesus
suffered because he proclaimed, with irresistible eloquence, a new
religion, one involving practically the existing institutions of the
priesthood, and their whole moral system. It was virtually the setting
up of a new deity in place of Jahveh, reason in place of the Bible, the
heart worshipping in spirit and in truth in place of the temple, and
humanizing the moral sentiment&mdash;turning the conventional morality
to &ldquo;dead works&rdquo; (Heb. vi. 1). He expected the reform to be
peaceful!</p>
<p>Rousseau&rsquo;s remark that Socrates died like a philosopher, but
Jesus like a god, has in it a truth more important than those who often
quote it recognise. Jesus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=
"#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>died, legendarily, so much like a
god that it is difficult to make out just what happened to the man.
Strong arguments have been made to prove that he did not die at all on
&ldquo;the cross&rdquo; (a word unknown to the New Testament),<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4128src" href="#xd21e4128" name="xd21e4128src">6</a>
and that Pilate not only &ldquo;set himself&rdquo; to save Jesus (John
xix. 12), but succeeded. There may have been from the stake a
despairing cry, afterwards shaped after a line from a psalm, but it can
hardly be determined whether this may not have been part of the first
post-resurrectional doctrine that the Son must be absolutely left by
his divine Father, and pass unaided through the ordeal of Satan, in
order to fulfil the conditions of a return from death. It is true,
however, that this primitive idea had almost vanished when the earliest
Gospel was written, and, although a relic of it may have been preserved
by tradition, there is an equal probability that Jesus did utter at the
stake a cry of despair. The whole miserable murderous affair,
unforeseen and disappointing, must have appeared to him a horrible
display of diabolism; and even after his friends believed in his
resurrection, and saw in the tragedy a sacrifice, they regarded it a
sacrifice hateful to his Father, and exacted only by the Devil.</p>
<p>Did he pray, &ldquo;Father forgive them, they know not what they
do&rdquo;? Only Luke reports this; its suppression by the other Gospels
suggests that its doctrinal significance was perceived. I heard a
preacher in the church of the Jesuits at Rome argue that Judas himself
is now in Paradise, because Jesus thus prayed for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>those who slew him, and the prayer of the Son of
God must have been answered. There is no apparent dogmatic purpose in
this incident, and it may be true.</p>
<p>The story of his confiding his mother to the disciple &ldquo;whom he
loved,&rdquo; told only by John, is evidently meant to complete the
assumption of a special favoritism towards that disciple, who is the
type of the good Spirit on one side of Jesus in contrast with Judas,
Satan&rsquo;s agent, on the other. The two are equally unhistorical and
allegorical. John and Judas became the good and evil Wandering Jews of
medi&aelig;val folklore.</p>
<p>The first Solomon had perished as a teacher of wisdom when he was
summoned from his tomb to utter the Jahvism of the &ldquo;Wisdom of
Solomon&rdquo;: the second and last Solomon was forever buried on the
day when Mary Magdalene saw his apparition, and cried, &ldquo;My
master!&rdquo; From that time may be dated the loss of the man Jesus,
and restoration in Christ of the Jahvism whose burden the wise teacher
had endeavored to lift from the heart and mind of the people.

compares the omission of the name of Moses for so many centuries with
the omission of Solomon&rsquo;s name. (<i lang="de">Geschichte des
Volkes Israel</i>, Bk. ii.). Such omissions do not, he says, cast doubt
on the historic character of either. The descriptive references to
Solomon during the time when his name is suppressed are more
continuous, and more historical. The utterance of Solomon&rsquo;s name
was probably at first avoided through Jahvist horror of his supposed
idolatry and worldliness, but as he was addressed in a psalm as
&ldquo;God,&rdquo; and as superstitions about his demon-commanding
power grew, it seems not improbable that there was some fear of using
his name, akin to the fear of uttering the proper name of God or of any
evil power.</p>

the wood and there am I.&rdquo; The last sentence seems to be based on
Eccles. x. 9: &ldquo;Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and
he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.&rdquo; The first

<h2 class="main">Postscripta.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early in the year 1896 a company of Jews performed at
the Novelty Theatre, London, in the Hebrew language, a drama entitled
&ldquo;King Solomon.&rdquo; It was an humble affair, and only about
three score in the audience&mdash;I and one very dear to me being
apparently the only &ldquo;Gentiles&rdquo; present. The drama was
mainly the legend of the Judgment of Solomon and that of the visit of
the Queen of Sheba, both conventionalized, and performed in an
automatic way, no spark of human passion or emotion animating either of
the women claiming the babe, or the Queen of Sheba. The part of Solomon
was acted by a fine-looking man, who went through it in the same
perfunctory way that characterized Joseph Meyer, the Oberammergau
Christ, as he appears to the undevout critical eye. Such has the
biblical Solomon become in Europe.</p>
<p>In the same week I attended a matin&eacute;e of
&ldquo;Aladdin&rdquo; in Drury Lane Theatre, which was crowded, mainly
with children, who were filled with delight by the fairy play. The
leading figures were elaborated from Solomonic lore. A beautiful being
in dazzling white raiment and crown appears to Aladdin; she is a
combination of the Queen of Sheba and Wisdom; she presents the youth
with a ring (symbol of Solomon&rsquo;s espousal with Wisdom, or as the
Abyssinians say, with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href=
"#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>Queen of Sheba); by means of this
ring he obtains the Wonderful Lamp (the reflected or terrestrial
wisdom). An Asmodeus, well versed in modern jugglery, charms the
audience with his tricks and antics, before proceeding to get hold of
the magic ring of Aladdin, and commanding the lamp, which he succeeds
in doing, as he succeeded with Solomon. This is what legendary Solomon
has become in Europe.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In European Folklore, Solomon and his old adversary, Asmodeus, now
better known as Mephistopheles, have long been blended. Solomon&rsquo;s
seal was the medi&aelig;val talisman to which the demon eagerly
responds. The Wisdom involved is all a matter of magic. It is wonderful
that so little recognition has been given in literature to the epical
dignity and beauty of the biblical legends of Solomon. In early English
literature there was at one time a tendency to ascribe to Solomon
various proverbs not in the Bible. In one old manuscript he is credited
with saying:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Save a thief from the gallows and he&rsquo;ll
help to hang thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Also,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Many a one leads a hungry life,</p>
<p class="line">And yet must needs wed a wife.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In Chaucer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Melib&aelig;us&rdquo; there
are ten proverbs ascribed to Solomon which are not in the Bible. But
generally it is Solomon the magician who has interested the poets. In
the old work, &ldquo;Salomon and Saturn,&rdquo; the wise man informs
Saturn that the most potent of all talismans is the Bible:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Golden is the Word of God,</p>
<p class="line">Stored with gems;</p>
<p class="line">It hath silver leaves; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Each one can,</p>
<p class="line">Through spiritual grace</p>
<p class="line">A Gospel relate.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And it is further said, &ldquo;Each (leaf) will subdue
devils.&rdquo; In a profounder vein Solomon says: &ldquo;All Evil is
from Fate; yet a wise-minded man may moderate every fate with
self-help, help of friends, and the divine spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In Prospero burying his Book, Shakespeare seems to have followed the
rabbinical legend that after Solomon by his written formulas had made
the devils serve him, in building the temple and other works, he
resolved to practice magic no more, and buried his book. But the devils
said to the people, &ldquo;he only ruled you by his book,&rdquo; and
pointed out where it was hidden; so they left the prophets and followed
magic.</p>
<p>At what time the notion arose that Solomon had demonic familiars
does not appear, but the story in 1 Kings iii. of the gift of wisdom
has some appearance of a reclamation for the deity of a credit that was
popularly ascribed to a rival power. However this may be, there is a
popular habit of tracing unusual human performances to Satan. As I
write this paragraph (in Paris) I note a theatrical placard announcing
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">les sataniques devins</span>&rdquo; of Williany
de Torre, a man who cries out the name and address you secretly select
in the Paris Directory. Why not advertise the divinations as
&ldquo;angelic&rdquo; instead of satanic? The heavenly beings have
somehow no great reputation for cleverness. Probably this is due to the
long association of intellectuality and science with heresy.</p>

<p>The late Lord Lytton (&ldquo;Owen Meredith&rdquo;) wrote a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>brief poem on a version given him by Robert
Browning of the story in my Preface, of Solomon leaning on his staff
long after he was dead: a worm gnaws the end of the staff and Solomon
falls, crumbled to dust, and nothing left visible but his crown. A poem
by Leigh Hunt, &ldquo;The Inevitable&rdquo; (in some editions,
&ldquo;The Angel of Death&rdquo;), tells of a man who, in terror of
Death, entreats Solomon to transport him to the remotest mountain of
Cathay. Solomon does so.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Solomon wished and the man vanished
straight;</p>
<p class="line">Up comes the Terror, with his orbs of fate:</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;Solomon,&rsquo; with a lofty voice said he,</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;How came that man here, wasting time with

<p class="line">I was to fetch him ere the close of day,</p>
<p class="line">From the remotest mountain of Cathay.<span class="corr"

<p class="line">Solomon said, bowing him to the ground,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">The story of the Fall of Man, in Genesis, so
fascinated Schopenhauer that he was ready to forgive the Bible all its
blunders. The whole world, said the great pessimist, looks like a vast
accumulation of evil developed from some absurdly small misstep. And
this misstep was precisely in accord with the philosophy of
Schopenhauer, who says that the great mistake of the universe is
&ldquo;consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That there were Schopenhaueresque ideas among some of the Solomonic
school may be seen in Koheleth (Ecclesiastes), who says, &ldquo;Be not
overwise; why commit suicide?&rdquo; (vii. 16.) I have remarked
elsewhere that the story of the serpent in Eden may have been put there
as a fling at Solomon and the scientific people, but on the other hand
it may be argued that it was a fable devised by the Solomonic school to
show how <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>Jahveh was outwitted in his attempt to breed a
race of idiots, for fear mankind might become as clever as himself. For
it was not the serpent that deceived Adam and Eve, but Jahveh, in
saying the forbidden fruit was fatal; the serpent told them the
truth.</p>
<p>The folk-tale that Solomon&rsquo;s staff was gnawed by a worm, and
his crowned body reduced to dust, suggests the idea of grandeur laid
low by some insignificant form, and in the same way Jahveh&rsquo;s
creation was overthrown by a worm. This humiliation of Jahveh has been
now somewhat lessened by the theory that Satan took the form of the
serpent, which Dante calls the worm, but nowhere in the Bible is there
any confusion of the reptile in Eden with any devil. &ldquo;If,&rdquo;
says Kalisch, &ldquo;the serpent represented Satan it would be
extremely surprising that the former only was cursed, and that the
latter is not even alluded to.&rdquo; In Genesis the extreme cleverness
of the serpent is recognized, and the truth of his statement to Eve
admitted, while Jahveh is shown in the ridiculous light of having his
deception about the fruit exposed by a worm, and betaking himself to
curses all round. These be thy gods, O Christians&mdash;for the Jews
absolutely ignored the tale in all their scriptures, and in the New
Testament Paul alone alludes to it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4240src"
href="#xd21e4240" name="xd21e4240src">1</a></p>
<p>The serpent in Eden is evidently the symbol of wisdom, of medical
art&mdash;Egyptian, Ph&oelig;nician, Greek&mdash;lifted in the
wilderness by Moses, and recognised by Jesus (&ldquo;Be wise as
serpents&rdquo;), with whom as an uplifted healer of mankind the
serpent-symbol was associated. But all of this is in contradiction to
the curses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>of Jahveh on the serpent, and on those to whom
the serpent brought wisdom. The fable, therefore, seems to be composed
of two antagonistic parts; it is a Solomonic anti-Jahvist fable with an
anti-Solomonic moral.</p>
<p>In the Pars&icirc; religion the fall of man was due to the first man
having been deceived by the Evil One into ascribing the good things in
creation to him&mdash;the Evil One.</p>
<p>In the same way the Christian ascribes to the Evil One man&rsquo;s
first taste of wisdom&mdash;the knowledge of good and evil&mdash;and
believes his first step above the brute to be a fall.</p>
<p>In the Pars&icirc; religion that fall of man, by a lie, was
recovered from by the creation of a new man. But in Christendom man has
not recovered from his fall, nor can he ever recover from it so long as
he disregards the new man&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;Be wise as
serpents,&rdquo; and continues to confuse his wisdom with
diabolism.</p>
<p>Only through the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and of the
eternal antagonism between them, can the tree of Life be reached.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In a Gnostic legend Solomon was summoned from his tomb and asked,
&ldquo;Who first named the name of God?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;The
Devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did reason permit belief in a personal devil, one might recognise
his supreme artifice in thus sheltering all the desolating cruelties of
men, all the discords and wars that have degraded mankind into nations
glorying in their ensigns of inhumanity, under a divine order.
Thenceforth the enemy of man became God&rsquo;s Devil, and whoso
accuses the scourges of man accuses the scourges of God. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span></p>
<p>Under the teaching of the Second Solomon his personal friends could
see in his tragical death a blow of the Devil aimed at God, who was
trying to subdue that lawless one, for whose existence or actions God
was in no sense responsible. But this was a transient glimpse. The
Devil&rsquo;s God was soon seen on his throne above the murderers of
the great man; the stake set up by the lynchers was shaped into a
symbolical cross; and all the cowardly, treacherous, murderous leaders,
and the vile lynchers, are raised into agents and priests of God,
presiding at a solemn rite and sacrifice for the salvation of
mankind.</p>
<p>Instead of salvation a curse fell on mankind with that lie, and
there are no signs of recovery from it. By the combination of Church
and State there has been evolved a new man&mdash;a Christian
restoration of deceived Yima&mdash;and no theological development
touches that misbeliever in every believer. The Unitarian, the Theist,
in their doctrine of a divine cosmos, the optimist, the pantheist, do
but rehabilitate and philosophically reinvest the lie that the diseases
and agonies in nature and in history are parts of a divinely ordered
universe. They, too, must see Judas and the lynchers carrying out the
plans of God. What then can they say of our contemporary betrayers of
justice, the national lynchers, who are crucifying humanity throughout
the world? These, too, carrying along their missionaries, are
projecting God into history! But it is the God who was first named by
the Devil, as the risen Solomon said, not the &ldquo;Eloi,&rdquo; the
source only of good, whom the great friend of man saw not in all that
wild chaos of violence amid which he perished, and his sublime religion
with him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Jahveh swears &ldquo;by his holiness&rdquo; (as in Ps. lxxxix.
35, Amos iv. 2), this holiness is not to be interpreted as moral, or in
any human sense. It relates to ancient philosophical ideas concerning
the spiritual and the material worlds. The supreme head of the
spiritual world is so far above the material world in majesty that he
cannot come in contact with matter, though this august
&ldquo;holiness&rdquo; has nothing to do with his moral character.
Indeed deities were in all countries considered quite above the moral
obligations of men. Jahveh&rsquo;s &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; required the
employment of mediators in creation&mdash;the Spirit of God brooding
over the waters, Wisdom the &ldquo;undefiled&rdquo; master-builder, the
Word&mdash;in each of whom is some image of his quasi-physiological
&ldquo;holiness,&rdquo; his transcendent immateriality.</p>
<p>It was amid these ancient conceptions that the various cults arose
which attempt to please and conciliate gods by ceremonial observances,
runes, recited formulas of petition or adulation, all based on the
awful &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; that doth hedge about a god, and concerned
with points of heavenly etiquette, without any implication of a moral
nature in those distant celestial beings. In Euripides&rsquo;
&ldquo;Iphigenia&rdquo; (line 20) it is said: &ldquo;Sometimes the
worship of the gods, not being conducted with exactness, overturns
one&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; In the same vein Koheleth (Ecclesiastes, v. 1,
2): &ldquo;Keep thy foot when thou goest into the house of God; for to
draw nigh to him with attention is better than to bring the sacrifices
of fools who know not that they are (? may be) doing wrong. Be not rash
with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before
God; for God is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242"
name="pb242">242</a>]</span>in heaven, and thou on earth; therefore let
thy words be few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in every race ethical development reaches a stage in which these
majestic beings, concerned only about their worship according to
etiquette, are challenged. Thus in the &ldquo;Cyclops&rdquo; of
Euripides (xxxv. 3&ndash;5), Ulysses says: &ldquo;O Jove, guardian of
strangers, behold these things; for if thou regardest them not, thou,
Jove, being nought, art vainly esteemed a god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the first Solomon to the last, the whole intellectual
development in Judea, which I have called Solomonic, means the
subjection of all conceptions of the divine nature and laws to the
moral sentiment and the reason of man. It was no denial of invisible
beings, or of man&rsquo;s relation to the universe, but a demand that
all definitions and conceptions should be approached through science,
experience and wisdom.</p>
<p>Solomon, and the Second Solomon, rest in their unknown graves; their
wisdom is corrupted; but their genius survives in the earth. Of old it
was said God looked down from heaven on the children of men, and found
that there was &ldquo;none that doeth good, no not one.&rdquo; But it
is now man who, with eyes illumined by the brave and cultured Solomons
of all lands and ages, looks upon the gods to see if there be one that
doeth good. The best of them are defended only by a plea that evil is
the mask of their benevolence. But it is not humanly moral to do evil
that good may come.</p>
<p>Our great Omar Khayy&aacute;m, by Fitzgerald&rsquo;s help, says:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;O Thou, who Man of baser earth didst
make,</p>
<p class="line">And ev&rsquo;n with Paradise devise the Snake:</p>
<p class="line xd21e794">For all the Sin wherewith the face of Man</p>
<p class="line">Is blacken&rsquo;d&mdash;Man&rsquo;s forgiveness
give&mdash;and take!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span></p>
<p>The agreement may be fair enough so far as it concerns Sin, in the
theological sense, but no Omnipotence, with unlimited choice of means
to ends, could be forgiven for the agonies of nature, even did they
result in benefits,&mdash;as generally they do not, so far as is known
to the experience of mankind.</p>
<p>It may be, as the American orator said, &ldquo;An honest god&rsquo;s
the noblest work of man&rdquo;; and innumerable hearts enshrine fair
personal ideals under uncomprehended names for deity; but each such
private ideal is unconsciously antagonistic to every
&ldquo;collectivist&rdquo; deity to whom the creation or the government
of the world is ascribed.</p>
<p>The human heart kneels before its vision, and with Mary Magdalene
cries Rabboni, <i>My</i> Master; but Theology recognizes only the
perfunctory Rabbi, and carries her beloved off into union with
thunder-god, war-god, or with a deified predatory Cosmos. Yet will not
the heart be bereaved of its vision; it still sees a smile of
tenderness in the universe. And philosophy, though it regard that smile
as a reflection of the heart&rsquo;s own love, may with all the more
certainty itself find a religion in this maternal divinity in the
earth, ever aspiring to its own supreme humanity.</p>
<p>Solomon passes, Jesus passes, but the Wisdom they loved as Bride, as
Mother, abides, however veiled in fables. She is still inspiring the
unfinished work of creation, and her delight is with the children of
men. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
